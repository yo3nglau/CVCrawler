Recently, there has been interest in the relationship between HNs and RBMs, due to their similarity under the statistical mechanics formalism. An exact mapping between HNs and RBMs has been previously noted for the special case of orthogonal (\u201cuncorrelated\u201d) encoded patterns. We present here an exact mapping in the case of correlated pattern HNs, which are more broadly applicable to existing datasets. Specifically, we show that any HN with $N$ binary variables and $p<N$ potentially correlated binary patterns can be transformed into an RBM with $N$ binary visible variables and $p$ gaussian hidden variables. We outline the conditions under which the reverse mapping exists, and conduct experiments on the MNIST dataset which suggest the mapping provides a useful initialization to the RBM weights. We discuss extensions, the potential importance of this correspondence for the training of RBMs, and for understanding the performance of feature extraction methods which utilize RBMs.", "one-sentence_summary": "Hopfield networks with correlated patterns can be mapped to Restricted Boltzmann Machines with orthogonal weights.

We translate each query into an end-to-end differentiable objective, where the truth value of each atom is computed by a pre-trained neural link predictor.

We offer such a study by proposing conditional language-specific routing (CLSR). CLSR employs hard binary gates conditioned on token representations to dynamically select LS or shared paths. By manipulating these gates, it can schedule LS capacity across sub-layers in MNMT subject to the guidance of translation signals and budget constraints. Moreover, CLSR can easily scale up to massively multilingual settings. Experiments with Transformer on OPUS-100 and WMT datasets show that: 1) MNMT is sensitive to both the amount and the position of LS modeling: distributing 10%-30% LS computation to the top and/or bottom encoder/decoder layers delivers the best performance; and 2) one-to-many translation benefits more from CLSR compared to many-to-one translation, particularly with unbalanced training data. Our study further verifies the trade-off between the shared capacity and LS capacity for multilingual translation.

Both curriculum learning, exposing a network to easier examples early in training, and anti-curriculum learning, showing the most difficult examples first, have been suggested as improvements to the standard i.i.d. training. In this work, we set out to investigate the relative benefits of ordered learning. We first investigate the implicit curricula resulting from architectural and optimization bias and find that samples are learned in a highly consistent order. Next, to quantify the benefit of explicit curricula, we conduct extensive experiments over thousands of orderings spanning three kinds of learning: curriculum, anti-curriculum, and random-curriculum -- in which the size of the training dataset is dynamically increased over time, but the examples are randomly ordered.

However, while LSH has sub-linear guarantees for approximate near-neighbor search in theory, it is known to have inefficient query time in practice due to its use of random hash functions. Moreover, when model parameters are changing, LSH suffers from update overhead. This work is motivated by an observation that model parameters evolve slowly, such that the changes do not always require an LSH update to maintain performance. This phenomenon points to the potential for a reduction in update time and allows for a modified learnable version of data-dependent LSH to improve query time at a low cost. We use the above insights to build MONGOOSE, an end-to-end LSH framework for efficient NN training.

In this paper, we ask the following question: how can we enable similarly useful pre-training for RL agents? We propose a method for pre-training behavioral priors that can capture complex input-output relationships observed in successful trials from a wide range of previously seen tasks, and we show how this learned prior can be used for rapidly learning new tasks without impeding the RL agent's ability to try out novel behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging robotic manipulation domains involving image observations and sparse reward functions, where our method outperforms prior works by a substantial margin.

When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.", "one-sentence_summary": "Transformers applied directly to image patches and pre-trained on large datasets work really well on image classification.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "dosovitskiy|an_image_is_worth_16x16_words_transformers_for_image_recognition_at_scale", "pdf": "/pdf/a4aa24aed16fcb6f23d1067f1a5ecf47d7115f63.pdf", "code": "[![github](/images/github_icon.svg) google-research/vision_transformer](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer) + [![Papers with Code](/images/pwc_icon.svg) 131 community implementations](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/?openreview=YicbFdNTTy)", "data": "[CIFAR-10](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cifar-10), [CIFAR-100](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cifar-100), [ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/imagenet), [ImageNet-W](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/imagenet-w), [JFT-300M](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/jft-300m), [ObjectNet](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/objectnet), [OmniBenchmark](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/omnibenchmark), [Oxford 102 Flower](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/oxford-102-flower), [VizWiz-Classification](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/vizwiz-classification)", "community_implementations": "[![CatalyzeX](/images/catalyzex_icon.svg) 15 code implementations](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/arxiv:2010.11929/code)", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Oral", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ndosovitskiy2021an,\ntitle={An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale},\nauthor={Alexey Dosovitskiy and Lucas Beyer and Alexander Kolesnikov and Dirk Weissenborn and Xiaohua Zhai and Thomas Unterthiner and Mostafa Dehghani and Matthias Minderer and Georg Heigold and Sylvain Gelly and Jakob Uszkoreit and Neil Houlsby},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference"], "pdate": 1610474034431, "odate": 1601660420211, "details": {"replyCount": 19}}, {"id": "XSLF1XFq5h", "original": "zr2ZL1sUni", "number": 1848, "cdate": 1601308203723, "ddate": null, "tcdate": 1601308203723, "tmdate": 1683307261051, "tddate": null, "forum": "XSLF1XFq5h", "replyto": null, "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/-/Blind_Submission", "content": {"title": "Getting a CLUE: A  Method for Explaining Uncertainty Estimates", "authorids": ["~Javier_Antoran1", "~Umang_Bhatt1", "~Tameem_Adel1", "~Adrian_Weller1", "~Jos\u00e9_Miguel_Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato1"], "authors": ["Javier Antoran", "Umang Bhatt", "Tameem Adel", "Adrian Weller", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato"], "keywords": ["interpretability", "uncertainty", "explainability"], "abstract": "Both uncertainty estimation and interpretability are important factors for trustworthy machine learning systems.

The common assumption is that these input-gradients contain information regarding $p_{\\theta} ( y\\mid \\mathbf{x} )$, the model's discriminative capabilities, thus justifying their use for interpretability. However, in this work, we show that these input-gradients can be arbitrarily manipulated as a consequence of the shift-invariance of softmax without changing the discriminative function. This leaves an open question: given that input-gradients can be arbitrary, why are they highly structured and explanatory in standard models?\n\nIn this work, we re-interpret the logits of standard softmax-based classifiers as unnormalized log-densities of the data distribution and show that input-gradients can be viewed as gradients of a class-conditional generative model $p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y)$ implicit in the discriminative model. This leads us to hypothesize that the highly structured and explanatory nature of input-gradients may be due to the alignment of this class-conditional model $p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y)$ with that of the ground truth data distribution $p_{\\text{data}} (\\mathbf{x} \\mid y)$. We test this hypothesis by studying the effect of density alignment on gradient explanations. To achieve this density alignment, we use an algorithm called score-matching, and propose novel approximations to this algorithm to enable training large-scale models.\n\nOur experiments show that improving the alignment of the implicit density model with the data distribution enhances gradient structure and explanatory power while reducing this alignment has the opposite effect. This also leads us to conjecture that unintended density alignment in standard neural network training may explain the highly structured nature of input-gradients observed in practice.

While purely data-driven approaches are arguably insufficient in this context, standard physical modeling based approaches tend to be over-simplistic, inducing non-negligible errors. In this work, we introduce the APHYNITY framework, a principled approach for augmenting incomplete physical dynamics described by differential equations with deep data-driven models. It consists in decomposing the dynamics into two components: a physical component accounting for the dynamics for which we have some prior knowledge, and a data-driven component accounting for errors of the physical model.

Working towards a theoretical explanation, we identify conditions under which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. First, we quantify the observation that ReLU MLPs quickly converge to linear functions along any direction from the origin, which implies that ReLU MLPs do not extrapolate most nonlinear functions. But, they can provably learn a linear target function when the training distribution is sufficiently diverse. Second, in connection to analyzing the successes and limitations of GNNs, these results suggest a hypothesis for which we provide theoretical and empirical evidence: the success of GNNs in extrapolating algorithmic tasks to new data (e.g., larger graphs or edge weights) relies on encoding task-specific non-linearities in the architecture or features.

The belief was challenged by recent studies where we can maintain the robustness and improve the accuracy. However, the other direction, whether we can keep the accuracy and improve the robustness, is conceptually and practically more interesting, since robust accuracy should be lower than standard accuracy for any model. In this paper, we show this direction is also promising. Firstly, we find even over-parameterized deep networks may still have insufficient model capacity, because adversarial training has an overwhelming smoothing effect. Secondly, given limited model capacity, we argue adversarial data should have unequal importance: geometrically speaking, a natural data point closer to/farther from the class boundary is less/more robust, and the corresponding adversarial data point should be assigned with larger/smaller weight. Finally, to implement the idea, we propose geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training, where the weights are based on how difficult it is to attack a natural data point. Experiments show that our proposal boosts the robustness of standard adversarial training; combining two directions, we improve both robustness and accuracy of standard adversarial training.", "one-sentence_summary": "This paper has proposed a novel adversarial training method, i.e., geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training (GAIRAT), which sheds new lights on improving the adversarial training.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "zhang|geometryaware_instancereweighted_adversarial_training", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/befac1f842cb530d192c70f91e2aae6bc3f03e20.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/746bc7119712b56c0426659dcb575f5864fa29ec.pdf", "data": "[CIFAR-10](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cifar-10), [SVHN](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/svhn)", "community_implementations": "[![CatalyzeX](/images/catalyzex_icon.svg) 9 code implementations](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/arxiv:2010.01736/code)", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Oral", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nzhang2021geometryaware,\ntitle={Geometry-aware Instance-reweighted Adversarial Training},\nauthor={Jingfeng Zhang and Jianing Zhu and Gang Niu and Bo Han and Masashi Sugiyama and Mohan Kankanhalli},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=iAX0l6Cz8ub}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference"], "pdate": 1610474082727, "odate": 1601660259560, "details": {"replyCount": 17}}, {"id": "JWOiYxMG92s", "original": "FNJG_16Zs5m", "number": 294, "cdate": 1601308040509, "ddate": null, "tcdate": 1601308040509, "tmdate": 1689818238940, "tddate": null, "forum": "JWOiYxMG92s", "replyto": null, "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/-/Blind_Submission", "content": {"title": "Free Lunch for Few-shot Learning:  Distribution Calibration", "authorids": ["~Shuo_Yang5", "~Lu_Liu7", "~Min_Xu5"], "authors": ["Shuo Yang", "Lu Liu", "Min Xu"], "keywords": ["few-shot learning", "image classification", "distribution estimation"], "abstract": "Learning from a limited number of samples is challenging since the learned model can easily become overfitted based on the biased distribution formed by only a few training examples. In this paper, we calibrate the distribution of these few-sample classes by transferring statistics from the classes with sufficient examples. Then an adequate number of examples can be sampled from the calibrated distribution to expand the inputs to the classifier. We assume every dimension in the feature representation follows a Gaussian distribution so that the mean and the variance of the distribution can borrow from that of similar classes whose statistics are better estimated with an adequate number of samples. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pretrained feature extractors and classification models without extra parameters. We show that a simple logistic regression classifier trained using the features sampled from our calibrated distribution can outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy on three datasets (~5% improvement on miniImageNet compared to the next best). The visualization of these generated features demonstrates that our calibrated distribution is an accurate estimation.

We propose a path towards natural data by first showing that the statistics of natural data provide enough structure to enable disentanglement, both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, we provide evidence that objects in natural movies undergo transitions that are typically small in magnitude with occasional large jumps, which is characteristic of a temporally sparse distribution. To address this finding we provide a novel proof that relies on a sparse prior on temporally adjacent observations to recover the true latent variables up to permutations and sign flips, directly providing a stronger result than previous work. We show that equipping practical estimation methods with our prior often surpasses the current state-of-the-art on several established benchmark datasets without any impractical assumptions, such as knowledge of the number of changing generative factors. Furthermore, we contribute two new benchmarks, Natural Sprites and KITTI Masks, which integrate the measured natural dynamics to enable disentanglement evaluation with more realistic datasets. We leverage these benchmarks to test our theory, demonstrating improved performance. We also identify non-obvious challenges for current methods in scaling to more natural domains.

While state-of-the-art 2D generative models like GANs show unprecedented quality in modeling the natural image manifold, it is unclear whether they implicitly capture the underlying 3D object structures. And if so, how could we exploit such knowledge to recover the 3D shapes of objects in the images? To answer these questions, in this work, we present the first attempt to directly mine 3D geometric cues from an off-the-shelf 2D GAN that is trained on RGB images only. Through our investigation, we found that such a pre-trained GAN indeed contains rich 3D knowledge and thus can be used to recover 3D shape from a single 2D image in an unsupervised manner. The core of our framework is an iterative strategy that explores and exploits diverse viewpoint and lighting variations in the GAN image manifold. The framework does not require 2D keypoint or 3D annotations, or strong assumptions on object shapes (e.g. shapes are symmetric), yet it successfully recovers 3D shapes with high precision for human faces, cats, cars, and buildings. The recovered 3D shapes immediately allow high-quality image editing like relighting and object rotation. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to previous methods in both 3D shape reconstruction and face rotation.
