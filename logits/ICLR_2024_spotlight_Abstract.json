SNNs learn low-dimensional embeddings of simplices in a simplicial complex by aggregating features of their respective upper, lower, boundary, and coboundary adjacent simplices. The aggregation in SNNs is carried out during training. Since the number of simplices of various orders in a simplicial complex is significantly large, the memory and training-time requirement in SNNs is enormous. In this work, we propose a scalable simplicial-aware neural network (SaNN) model with a constant run-time and memory requirements independent of the size of the simplicial complex and the density of interactions in it. SaNN is based on pre-aggregated simplicial-aware features as inputs to a neural network, so it has a strong simplicial-structural inductive bias. We provide theoretical conditions under which SaNN is provably more powerful than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test and as powerful as the simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) test. We also show that SaNN is permutation and orientation equivariant and satisfies simplicial-awareness of the highest order in a simplicial complex. We demonstrate via numerical experiments that despite being computationally economical, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting trajectories,  simplicial closures, and classifying graphs."}, "primary_area": {"value": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/b5b2e785dec69b9ea0c8b01d6e2eca5896246cce.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/0409d0bfd0e6b9c23876ef435a4f64eed976a61e.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\ngurugubelli2024sann,\ntitle={Sa{NN}: Simple Yet Powerful Simplicial-aware Neural Networks},\nauthor={Sravanthi Gurugubelli and Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=eUgS9Ig8JG}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "gurugubelli|sann_simple_yet_powerful_simplicialaware_neural_networks"}}, "number": 9491, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9491/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9491/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9491/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695557389659, "cdate": 1695557389659, "tmdate": 1710599804238, "mdate": 1710599804238, "pdate": 1705411064661, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 37, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "kmn0BhQk7p", "forum": "kmn0BhQk7p", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9451/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9451/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Beyond Memorization: Violating Privacy via Inference with Large Language Models"}, "authors": {"value": ["Robin Staab", "Mark Vero", "Mislav Balunovic", "Martin Vechev"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Robin_Staab1", "~Mark_Vero1", "~Mislav_Balunovic1", "~Martin_Vechev1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Privacy", "Large Language Models"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from texts given at inference."}, "abstract": {"value": "Current privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models\u2019 inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals\u2019 privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to 85% top-1 and 95% top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost (100x) and time (240x) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for stronger and wider privacy protection."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/0174f3bf08c7c34d3feb07ca6e5b488bb3efc21c.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/61cc0fc6c710cade7f97605f0d40b5f909c094c2.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nstaab2024beyond,\ntitle={Beyond Memorization: Violating Privacy via Inference with Large Language Models},\nauthor={Robin Staab and Mark Vero and Mislav Balunovic and Martin Vechev},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=kmn0BhQk7p}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "staab|beyond_memorization_violating_privacy_via_inference_with_large_language_models"}}, "number": 9451, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9451/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9451/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9451/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695555710153, "cdate": 1695555710153, "tmdate": 1710503155247, "mdate": 1710503155247, "pdate": 1705411064088, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 25, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "SLw9fp4yI6", "forum": "SLw9fp4yI6", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9377/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9377/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Controlled Text Generation via Language Model Arithmetic"}, "authors": {"value": ["Jasper Dekoninck", "Marc Fischer", "Luca Beurer-Kellner", "Martin Vechev"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Jasper_Dekoninck1", "~Marc_Fischer1", "~Luca_Beurer-Kellner1", "~Martin_Vechev1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Controlled text generation", "LLM", "Natural Language Processing"]}, "abstract": {"value": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed more widely, customization with respect to vocabulary, style, and character becomes more important. In this work, we introduce model arithmetic, a novel inference framework for composing and biasing LLMs without the need for model (re)training or highly specific datasets. In addition, the framework allows for more precise control of generated text than direct prompting and prior controlled text generation (CTG) techniques. Using model arithmetic, we can express prior CTG techniques as simple formulas and naturally extend them to new and more effective formulations. Further, we show that speculative sampling, a technique for efficient LLM sampling, extends to our setting. This enables highly efficient text generation with multiple composed models with only marginal overhead over a single model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that model arithmetic allows fine-grained control of generated text while outperforming state-of-the-art on the task of toxicity reduction.

Although existing approaches for node anomaly detection have shown effectiveness, they have yet to fully address two major challenges: operating in settings with limited supervision and managing class imbalance effectively. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel model, ConsisGAD, which is tailored for GAD in scenarios characterized by limited supervision and is anchored in the principles of consistency training. Under limited supervision, ConsisGAD effectively leverages the abundance of unlabeled data for consistency training by incorporating a novel learnable data augmentation mechanism, thereby introducing controlled noise into the dataset. Moreover, ConsisGAD takes advantage of the variance in homophily distribution between normal and anomalous nodes to craft a simplified GNN backbone, enhancing its capability to distinguish effectively between these two classes. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of ConsisGAD in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.

To address this issue, many studies have focused on propensity-based methods to combat the selection bias by reweighting the sample loss, and demonstrate that\nbalancing is important for debiasing both theoretically and empirically. However, there are two questions that still need to be addressed: which function class should be balanced and how to effectively balance that function class? In this paper, we first perform theoretical analysis to show the effect of balancing finite-dimensional function classes on the bias of IPS and DR methods, and based on this, we propose a universal kernel-based balancing method to balance functions on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In addition, we propose a novel adaptive causal balancing method during the alternating update between unbiased evaluation and training of the prediction model. Specifically, the prediction loss of the model is projected in the kernel-based covariate function space, and the projection coefficients are used to determine which functions should be prioritized for balancing to reduce the estimation bias.

These require strategic exploration algorithms that use relatively limited function classes for representing the policy or value function. Our goal is to explain why deep RL algorithms often perform well in practice, despite using random exploration and much more expressive function classes like neural networks. Our work arrives at an explanation by showing that many stochastic MDPs can be solved by performing only a few steps of value iteration on the random policy\u2019s Q function and then acting greedily. When this is true, we find that it is possible to separate the exploration and learning components of RL, making it much easier to analyze. We introduce a new RL algorithm, SQIRL, that iteratively learns a near-optimal policy by exploring randomly to collect rollouts and then performing a limited number of steps of fitted-Q iteration over those roll- outs. We find that any regression algorithm that satisfies basic in-distribution generalization properties can be used in SQIRL to efficiently solve common MDPs. This can explain why deep RL works with complex function approximators like neural networks, since it is empirically established that neural networks generalize well in-distribution. Furthermore, SQIRL explains why random exploration works well in practice, since we show many environments can be solved by effectively estimating the random policy\u2019s Q-function and then applying zero or a few steps of value iteration. We leverage SQIRL to derive instance-dependent sample complexity bounds for RL that are exponential only in an \u201ceffective horizon\u201d of lookahead\u2014which is typically much smaller than the full horizon\u2014and on the complexity of the class used for function approximation. Empirically, we also find that SQIRL performance strongly correlates with PPO and DQN performance in a variety of stochastic environments, supporting that our theoretical analysis is predictive of practical performance.

This codebook is trained jointly to optimize task reward and acts as a task-conditioned selective filter over the visual observation.\nOur experiments showcase state-of-the-art performance for object goal navigation and object displacement across $5$ benchmarks, ProcTHOR, ArchitecTHOR, RoboTHOR, AI2-iTHOR, and ManipulaTHOR. The filtered representations produced by the codebook are also able generalize better and converge faster when adapted to other simulation environments such as Habitat. Our qualitative analyses show that agents explore their environments more effectively and their representations retain task-relevant information like target object recognition while ignoring superfluous information about other objects."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and

PDEs as soft constraints, train with a composite loss function that contains multiple training point types: different types of collocation points chosen during training to enforce each PDE and

Training PINNs using this loss function is challenging as it typically requires selecting large numbers of points of different types, each with different training dynamics. Unlike past works that focused on the selection of either collocation or experimental points, this work introduces PINN Adaptive ColLocation and Experimental points selection (PINNACLE), the first algorithm that jointly optimizes the selection of all training point types, while automatically adjusting the proportion of collocation point types as training progresses. PINNACLE uses information on the interactions among training point types, which had not been considered before, based on an analysis of PINN training dynamics via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We theoretically show that the criterion used by PINNACLE is related to the PINN generalization error, and empirically demonstrate that PINNACLE is able to outperform existing point selection methods

normal or anomalous based solely on the data from a single class during training. Various attempts have been made to learn suitable representations for OCC within a self-supervised framework. Notably, discriminative methods that use geometric visual transformations, such as rotation, to generate pseudo-anomaly samples have exhibited impressive detection performance. Although rotation is commonly viewed as a distribution-shifting transformation and is widely used in the literature, the cause of its effectiveness remains a mystery. In this study, we are the first to make a surprising observation: there exists a strong linear relationship (Pearson's Correlation, $r > 0.9$) between the accuracy of rotation prediction and the performance of OCC. This suggests that a classifier that effectively distinguishes different rotations is more likely to excel in OCC, and vice versa. The root cause of this phenomenon can be attributed to the transformation bias in the dataset, where representations learned from transformations already present in the dataset tend to be less effective, making it essential to accurately estimate the transformation distribution before utilizing pretext tasks involving these transformations for reliable self-supervised representation learning. To the end, we propose a novel two-stage method to estimate the transformation distribution within the dataset.

This inconsistency introduces robustness challenges for SSL algorithms. In this paper, we first propose several robustness metrics for SSL based on the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC), secondly, we establish a theoretical framework for studying the generalization performance and robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments, thirdly, we re-implement widely adopted SSL algorithms within a unified SSL toolkit and evaluate their performance on proposed open environment SSL benchmarks, including both image, text, and tabular datasets. By investigating the empirical and theoretical results, insightful discussions on enhancing the robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments are presented.

Recent works have shown that off-policy learning can make in-context RL with recurrent policies viable. Nonetheless, these approaches require extensive tuning and limit scalability by creating key bottlenecks in agents' memory capacity, planning horizon, and model size. AMAGO revisits and redesigns the off-policy in-context approach to successfully train long-sequence Transformers over entire rollouts in parallel with end-to-end RL.

However, human preferences are multi-faceted, and it is increasingly common to derive reward from a composition of simpler reward models which each capture a different aspect of language quality. This itself presents a challenge, as it is difficult to appropriately weight these component RMs when combining them. Compounding this difficulty, because any RM is only a proxy for human evaluation, this process is vulnerable to *overoptimization*, wherein past a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse human ratings. In this paper, we perform the first study on overoptimization in composite RMs, showing that correlation between component RMs has a significant effect on the locations of these points. We then introduce an approach to solve this issue using constrained reinforcement learning as a means of preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's threshold of usefulness. Our method addresses the problem of weighting component RMs by learning dynamic weights, naturally given by the Lagrange multipliers. As a result, each RM stays within the range at which it is an effective proxy, improving evaluation performance.

While high-quality images naturally result in more precise detection and classification, they also result in a heavier computational workload for imaging and processing, reduce camera refresh rates, and increase the volume of data communication between the camera and processor. Taking inspiration from the foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, saccade mechanism observed in the human visual system and the filling-in phenomena of brain, we have developed an active scene reconstruction architecture based on multiple foveal views. This model stitches together information from foveal and peripheral vision, which are sampled from multiple glances. Assisted by a reinforcement learning-based saccade mechanism, our model reduces the required input pixels by over 90\\% per frame while maintaining the same level of performance in image recognition as with the original images.

This approach has two limitations: i) the scores lack interpretability, and human annotators struggle with giving consistent scores; ii) most scoring methods are based on (reference, translation) pairs, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where references are absent. In practice, we often care about whether a new MT system is better or worse than some competitors. In addition, reference-free MT evaluation is increasingly practical and necessary. Unfortunately, these two practical considerations have yet to be jointly explored. In this work, we formulate the reference-free MT evaluation into a pairwise ranking problem. Given the source sentence and a pair of translations, our system predicts which translation is better. In addition to proposing this new formulation, we further show that this new paradigm can demonstrate superior correlation with human judgments by merely using indirect supervision from natural language inference and weak supervision from our synthetic data. In the context of reference-free evaluation, MT-Ranker, trained without any human annotations, achieves state-of-the-art results on the WMT Shared Metrics Task benchmarks DARR20, MQM20, and MQM21.

We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models on multistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. This dataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novel neurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the construction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder mysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more capable LLMs are released. Second, our data instances are free text narratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it simultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted benchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to solve with high accuracy.

Assuming only the existence of an exploratory distribution with good coverage, a structural condition known as *coverability* (Xie et al., 2023), we give a new algorithm (GLOW) that uses density ratio realizability and value function realizability to perform sample-efficient online exploration. GLOW addresses unbounded density ratios via careful use of truncation, and combines this with optimism to guide exploration. GLOW is computationally inefficient; we complement it with a more efficient counterpart, HyGLOW, for the Hybrid RL setting (Song et al., 2023) wherein online RL is augmented with additional offline data.

In this work, we present a solution to this trade-off. PSI-KT is a hierarchical generative approach that explicitly models how both individual cognitive traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge influence learning dynamics, thus achieving interpretability by design. Moreover, by using scalable Bayesian inference, PSI-KT targets the real-world need for efficient personalization even with a growing body of learners and interaction data. Evaluated on three datasets from online learning platforms, PSI-KT achieves superior multi-step **p**redictive accuracy and **s**calable inference in continual-learning settings, all while providing **i**nterpretable representations of learner-specific traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge that causally supports learning. In sum, predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing with solid knowledge mapping lays a key foundation for effective personalized learning to make education accessible to a broad, global audience."}, "primary_area": {"value": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/52c2533f0586eecd513971405b1c38d7810ec28b.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/5894d4b61a69bee95b6b2de7013fd1b76828d1ee.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nzhou2024predictive,\ntitle={Predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing on structured domains},\nauthor={Hanqi Zhou and Robert Bamler and Charley M Wu and {\\'A}lvaro Tejero-Cantero},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=NgaLU2fP5D}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "zhou|predictive_scalable_and_interpretable_knowledge_tracing_on_structured_domains"}}, "number": 8234, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8234/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8234/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8234/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695501550757, "cdate": 1695501550757, "tmdate": 1710446811982, "mdate": 1710446811982, "pdate": 1705411035456, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 15, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "vngVydDWft", "forum": "vngVydDWft", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8194/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8194/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "From Bricks to Bridges: Product of Invariances to Enhance Latent Space Communication"}, "authors": {"value": ["Irene Cannistraci", "Luca Moschella", "Marco Fumero", "Valentino Maiorca", "Emanuele Rodol\u00e0"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Irene_Cannistraci1", "~Luca_Moschella1", "~Marco_Fumero1", "~Valentino_Maiorca1", "~Emanuele_Rodol\u00e01"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["invariance", "latent space", "latent comunication", "zero-shot stitching", "representation learning", "relative representation"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "Incorporate invariances into neural representations to construct a product space of invariant components and unlock applications, such as merging, stitching, and reusing different neural modules."}, "abstract": {"value": "It has been observed that representations learned by distinct neural networks conceal structural similarities when the models are trained under similar inductive biases. From a geometric perspective, identifying the classes of transformations and the related invariances that connect these representations is fundamental to unlocking applications, such as merging, stitching, and reusing different neural modules. However, estimating task-specific transformations a priori can be challenging and expensive due to several factors (e.g., weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or data modality). To this end, we introduce a versatile method to directly incorporate a set of invariances into the representations, constructing a product space of invariant components on top of the latent representations without requiring prior knowledge about the optimal invariance to infuse. We validate our solution on classification and reconstruction tasks, observing consistent latent similarity and downstream performance improvements in a zero-shot stitching setting.

A common criticism, however, is that each circuit is task-specific, and thus such analysis cannot contribute to understanding the models at a higher level. In this work, we present evidence that insights (both low-level findings about specific heads and higher-level findings about general algorithms) can indeed generalize across tasks. Specifically, we study the circuit discovered in (Wang, 2022) for the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task and 1.) show that it reproduces on a larger GPT2 model, and 2.) that it is mostly reused to solve a seemingly different task: Colored Objects (Ippolito & Callison-Burch, 2023). We provide evidence that the process underlying both tasks is functionally very similar, and contains about a 78% overlap in in-circuit attention heads. We further present a proof-of-concept intervention experiment, in which we adjust four attention heads in middle layers in order to \u2018repair\u2019 the Colored Objects circuit and make it behave like the IOI circuit.

In this work, we show that they can also be excellent likelihood models, so long as we overcome a fundamental difficulty with probabilistic multi-scale models: the intractability of the likelihood function. Chiefly, in cascaded models each intermediary scale introduces extraneous variables that cannot be tractably marginalized out for likelihood evaluation. This issue vanishes by modeling the diffusion process on latent spaces induced by a class of transformations we call hierarchical volume-preserving maps, which decompose spatially structured data in a hierarchical fashion without introducing local distortions in the latent space. We demonstrate that two such maps are well-known in the literature for multiscale modeling: Laplacian pyramids and wavelet transforms. Not only do such reparameterizations allow the likelihood function to be directly expressed as a joint likelihood over the scales, we show that the Laplacian pyramid and wavelet transform also produces significant improvements to the state-of-the-art on a selection of benchmarks in likelihood modeling, including density estimation, lossless compression, and out-of-distribution detection.

We instead present IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, a new approach where language models are trained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries. Our approach builds on the fact that current pipelines train by concatenating random sets of shorter documents to create longer context windows; this improves efficiency even though the prior documents provide no signal for predicting the next document. Given this fact, we can do IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING by simply changing the document ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly applying existing pretraining pipelines. However, this document sorting problem is challenging. There are billions of documents and we would like the sort to maximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data. To do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documents with efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent batches with a graph cover algorithm.

This paper investigates different variations of diffusion modeling for unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection. In particular, we find that Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (DDPM) are performant on anomaly detection benchmarks yet computationally expensive. By simplifying DDPM in application to anomaly detection, we are naturally led to an alternative approach called Diffusion Time Estimation (DTE). DTE estimates the distribution over diffusion time for a given input and uses the mode or mean of this distribution as the anomaly score. We derive an analytical form for this density and leverage a deep neural network to improve inference efficiency. Through empirical evaluations on the ADBench benchmark, we demonstrate that all diffusion-based anomaly detection methods perform competitively for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Notably, DTE achieves orders of magnitude faster inference time than DDPM, while outperforming it on this benchmark. These results establish diffusion-based anomaly detection as a scalable alternative to traditional methods and recent deep-learning techniques for standard unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings."}, "primary_area": {"value": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/c6480e4c58a2924ca498ff399ce467bb1e61ed7b.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/d1a5a7c4099974be80d2a2dfd690e85cceae3cae.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nlivernoche2024on,\ntitle={On Diffusion Modeling for Anomaly Detection},\nauthor={Victor Livernoche and Vineet Jain and Yashar Hezaveh and Siamak Ravanbakhsh},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=lR3rk7ysXz}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "livernoche|on_diffusion_modeling_for_anomaly_detection"}}, "number": 7999, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7999/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7999/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7999/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695493283945, "cdate": 1695493283945, "tmdate": 1710453603103, "mdate": 1710453603103, "pdate": 1705411026297, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 13, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "tjn2YZSHUv", "forum": "tjn2YZSHUv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7993/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7993/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Social Reward: Evaluating and Enhancing Generative AI through Million-User Feedback from an Online Creative Community"}, "authors": {"value": ["Arman Isajanyan", "Artur Shatveryan", "David Kocharian", "Zhangyang Wang", "Humphrey Shi"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Arman_Isajanyan1", "~Artur_Shatveryan1", "~David_Kocharian1", "~Zhangyang_Wang1", "~Humphrey_Shi1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["human feedback", "text to image", "generative AI", "image quality scoring"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Social reward as a form of community recognition provides a strong source of\nmotivation for users of online platforms to actively engage and contribute with\ncontent to accumulate peers approval.

connected convolutional neural networks (LCNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNs) fall into one of the following categories: either they disregard the optimizer and only provide uniform convergence upper bounds with no separating lower bounds, \n    or they consider simplistic tasks that do not truly mirror the locality and translation invariance as found in real-world vision tasks.\n    To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) classification task that models an image as consisting of $k$ patches, each of dimension $d$, and the label is determined by a $d$-sparse signal vector that can freely appear in any one of the $k$ patches. \n    On this task, for any orthogonally equivariant algorithm like gradient descent, we prove that CNNs require $\\tilde{O}(k+d)$ samples, whereas LCNs require $\\Omega(kd)$ samples, establishing the statistical advantages of weight sharing in translation invariant tasks. \n    Furthermore, LCNs need $\\tilde{O}(k(k+d))$ samples, compared to $\\Omega(k^2d)$ samples for FCNs, showcasing the benefits of locality in local tasks.\n    Additionally, we develop information theoretic tools for

discovered through program search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It achieves results comparable to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As what we can expect from the result of the random search, Lion blends a number of elements from existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight decay,  Polayk and Nesterov momentum, but doesn't fit into any existing category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its theoretical basis remains uncertain. This absence of theoretical clarity limits opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy. This work aims to demystify Lion. Using both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a novel and theoretically grounded approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while enforcing a bound constraint $||x||_\\infty \\leq 1/\\lambda$. Lion achieves this through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\\lambda$ represents the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is facilitated by the development of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a wide range of Lion-$\\phi$ algorithms, where the  $sign(\\cdot)$ operator in Lion is replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\\phi$, leading to the solution of the general composite optimization problem $\\min_x f(x) + \\phi^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion and pave the way for further enhancements and extensions of Lion-related algorithms."}, "primary_area": {"value": "optimization"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/415e0c57e06c454b4abc460e3311a5bc3e5c9b6b.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/f312447ae5de7c3fe14343dff00c27e7f97c7ca6.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nchen2024lion,\ntitle={Lion Secretly Solves a Constrained Optimization: As Lyapunov Predicts},\nauthor={Lizhang Chen and Bo Liu and Kaizhao Liang and qiang liu},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=e4xS9ZarDr}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "chen|lion_secretly_solves_a_constrained_optimization_as_lyapunov_predicts"}}, "number": 7914, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7914/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7914/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7914/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695490352975, "cdate": 1695490352975, "tmdate": 1713517251400, "mdate": 1713517251400, "pdate": 1705411023291, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 14, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "optimization", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "TTrzgEZt9s", "forum": "TTrzgEZt9s", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7912/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7912/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Distributionally Robust Optimization with Bias and Variance Reduction"}, "authors": {"value": ["Ronak Mehta", "Vincent Roulet", "Krishna Pillutla", "Zaid Harchaoui"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Ronak_Mehta2", "~Vincent_Roulet1", "~Krishna_Pillutla1", "~Zaid_Harchaoui1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["stochastic optimization", "convex optimization", "distributionally robust learning", "spectral risk measures", "incremental optimization"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We propose a linearly convergent stochastic (a.k.a. incremental) algorithm that optimizes spectral risk measures, which are distributionally robust objectives that include the superquantile."}, "abstract": {"value": "We consider the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, wherein a learner optimizes the worst-case empirical risk achievable by reweighing the observed training examples.

It is natural to wonder how well these models adapt to genuinely new tasks, but how does one find tasks that are unseen in internet-scale training sets? We turn to a field that is explicitly motivated and bottlenecked by a scarcity of web data: low-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce MTOB (Machine Translation from One Book), a benchmark for learning to translate between English and Kalamang\u2014a language with less than 200 speakers and therefore virtually no presence on the web\u2014using several hundred pages of field linguistics reference materials. This task framing is novel in that it asks a model to learn a language from a single human-readable book of grammar explanations, rather than a large mined corpus of in-domain data, more akin to L2 language learning than L1 language acquisition. We demonstrate that baselines using current LLMs are promising but fall short of human performance, achieving 44.7 chrF on Kalamang to English translation and 45.8 chrF on English to Kalamang translation, compared to 51.6 and 57.0 chrF by a human who learned Kalamang from the same reference materials.

In offline reinforcement learning (RL), Decision Transformer (DT) is emerging as a promising model based on Transformer. However, we discovered that the attention module of DT is not appropriate to capture the inherent local dependence pattern in trajectories of RL modeled as a Markov decision process. To overcome the limitations of DT, we propose a novel action sequence predictor, named Decision ConvFormer (DC), based on the architecture of MetaFormer, which is a general structure to process multiple entities in parallel and understand the interrelationship among the multiple entities.

While conventional reward models (RMs) have exhibited remarkable scalability, they oft struggle with fundamental functionality such as arithmetic computation, code execution, and factual lookup. In this paper, we propose a tool-augmented preference modeling approach, named Themis, to address these limitations by empowering RMs with access to external environments, including calculators and search engines. This approach not only fosters synergy between tool utilization and reward grading but also enhances interpretive capacity and scoring reliability. Our study delves into the integration of external tools into RMs, enabling them to interact with diverse external sources and construct task-specific tool engagement and reasoning traces in an autoregressive manner. We validate our approach across a wide range of domains, incorporating seven distinct external tools. Our experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy overall improvement of 17.7% across eight tasks in preference ranking. Furthermore, our approach outperforms Gopher 280B by 7.3% on TruthfulQA task in zero-shot evaluation. In human evaluations, RLHF trained with Themis attains an average win rate of 32% when compared to baselines across four distinct tasks. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive collection of tool-related RM datasets, incorporating data from seven distinct tool APIs, totaling 15,000 instances.

Dynamics models that are learned by fitting historical transitions often struggle to generalize to unseen transitions. In this study, we identify a hidden but pivotal factor termed dynamics reward that remains consistent across transitions, offering a pathway to better generalization. Therefore, we propose the idea of reward-consistent dynamics models: any trajectory generated by the dynamics model should maximize the dynamics reward derived from the data. We implement this idea as the MOREC (Model-based Offline reinforcement learning with Reward Consistency) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into previous offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods. MOREC learns a generalizable dynamics reward function from offline data, which is subsequently employed as a transition filter in any offline MBRL method: when generating transitions, the dynamics model generates a batch of transitions and selects the one with the highest dynamics reward value. On a synthetic task, we visualize that MOREC has a strong generalization ability and can surprisingly recover some distant unseen transitions. On 21 offline tasks in D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, MOREC improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin, i.e., 4.6\\% on D4RL tasks and 25.9\\% on NeoRL tasks. Notably, MOREC is the first method that can achieve above 95\\% online RL performance in 6 out of 12 D4RL tasks and 3 out of 9 NeoRL tasks.

It has been shown that this objective can be represented as an optimization problem of state-action visitation distribution under linear constraints. The dual problem of this formulation, which we refer to as *dual RL*, is unconstrained and easier to optimize. In this work, we first cast several state-of-the-art offline RL and offline imitation learning (IL) algorithms as instances of dual RL approaches with shared structures. Such unification allows us to identify the root cause of the shortcomings of prior methods. For offline IL, our analysis shows that prior methods are based on a restrictive coverage assumption that greatly limits their performance in practice. To fix this limitation, we propose a new discriminator-free method ReCOIL that learns to imitate from arbitrary off-policy data to obtain near-expert performance. For offline RL, our analysis frames a recent offline RL method XQL in the dual framework, and we further propose a new method $f$-DVL that provides alternative choices to the Gumbel regression loss that fixes the known training instability issue of XQL. The performance improvements by both of our proposed methods, ReCOIL and $f$-DVL, in IL and RL are validated on an extensive suite of simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/981af9a85be76008d6063c6ddd1477450c3bf463.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/a980e449192699b610c6e3ee69309be5fbbd5161.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nsikchi2024dual,\ntitle={Dual {RL}: Unification and New Methods for Reinforcement and Imitation Learning},\nauthor={Harshit Sikchi and Qinqing Zheng and Amy Zhang and Scott Niekum},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=xt9Bu66rqv}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "sikchi|dual_rl_unification_and_new_methods_for_reinforcement_and_imitation_learning"}}, "number": 7641, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7641/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7641/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7641/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695481445327, "cdate": 1695481445327, "tmdate": 1709661541700, "mdate": 1709661541700, "pdate": 1705411015846, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 21, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "reinforcement learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "Bo6GpQ3B9a", "forum": "Bo6GpQ3B9a", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7586/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7586/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Out-Of-Domain Unlabeled Data Improves Generalization"}, "authors": {"value": ["seyed amir hossein saberi", "Amir Najafi", "Alireza Heidari", "Mohammad Hosein Movasaghinia", "Abolfazl Motahari", "Babak Khalaj"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~seyed_amir_hossein_saberi1", "~Amir_Najafi1", "~Alireza_Heidari2", "~Mohammad_Hosein_Movasaghinia1", "~Abolfazl_Motahari1", "~Babak_Khalaj1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Out-of-domain data", "Semi-supervised learing", "learning theory", "generalization bound", "adversarial robustness"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We propose a framework to incorporate unlabeled out-of-domain samples in order to enhance the generalization error.

Notably, we allow the unlabeled samples to deviate slightly (in total variation sense) from the in-domain distribution. The core idea behind our framework is to combine Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with self-supervised training. As a result, we also leverage efficient polynomial-time algorithms for the training stage. From a theoretical standpoint, we apply our framework on the classification problem of a mixture of two Gaussians in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where in addition to the $m$ independent and labeled samples from the true distribution, a set of $n$ (usually with $n\\gg m$) out of domain and unlabeled samples are gievn as well. Using only the labeled data, it is known that the generalization error can be bounded by $\\propto\\left(d/m\\right)^{1/2}$. However, using our method on both isotropic and non-isotropic Gaussian mixture models, one can derive a new set of analytically explicit and non-asymptotic bounds which show substantial improvement on the generalization error compared ERM. Our results underscore two significant insights: 1) out-of-domain samples, even when unlabeled, can be harnessed to narrow the generalization gap, provided that the true data distribution adheres to a form of the \"cluster assumption\", and 2) the semi-supervised learning paradigm can be regarded as a special case of our framework when there are no distributional shifts.

Extensive efforts have been made before model release to align their behavior with human values, with the primary goal of ensuring their helpfulness and harmlessness. However, even carefully aligned models can be manipulated maliciously, leading to unintended behaviors, known as ``jailbreaks\". These jailbreaks are typically triggered by specific text inputs, often referred to as adversarial prompts. In this work, we propose the generation exploitation attack, an extremely simple approach that disrupts model alignment by only manipulating variations of decoding methods. By exploiting different generation strategies, including varying decoding hyper-parameters and sampling methods, we increase the attack success rate from $0\\%$ to more than $95\\%$ across 11 language models including LLaMA2, Vicuna, Falcon, and MPT families, outperforming state-of-the-art attacks with $30\\times$ lower computational cost. Finally, we propose an effective alignment method that explores diverse generation strategies, which can reasonably reduce the attack success rate under our attack.

settings by adaptively fitting graph filters of arbitrary shapes. \nYet, their applications in unsupervised learning are rarely explored.\nBased on the above analysis, a natural question arises: Can we incorporate the excellent properties of spectral polynomial filters into graph contrastive learning?\nIn this paper, we address the question by studying the necessity of introducing high-pass information for heterophily from a spectral perspective.\nWe propose PolyGCL, a GCL pipeline that utilizes polynomial filters to achieve contrastive learning between the low-pass and high-pass views.\nSpecifically, PolyGCL utilizes polynomials with learnable filter functions to generate different spectral views and an objective that incorporates high-pass information through a linear combination. \nWe theoretically prove that PolyGCL outperforms previous GCL paradigms when applied to graphs with varying levels of homophily.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and

"Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is extensively used for solving complex cooperative tasks, and value decomposition methods are a prevalent approach for this domain. However, these methods have not been successful in addressing both homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks simultaneously which is a crucial aspect for the practical application of cooperative agents. \nOn one hand, value decomposition methods demonstrate superior performance in homogeneous tasks. Nevertheless, they tend to produce agents with similar policies, which is unsuitable for heterogeneous tasks. On the other hand, solutions based on personalized observation or assigned roles are well-suited for heterogeneous tasks. However, they often lead to a trade-off situation where the agent's performance in homogeneous scenarios is negatively affected due to the aggregation of distinct policies. An alternative approach is to adopt sequential execution policies, which offer a flexible form for learning both types of tasks. However, learning sequential execution policies poses challenges in terms of credit assignment, and the limited information about subsequently executed agents can lead to sub-optimal solutions, which is known as the relative over-generalization problem. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Greedy Sequential Execution (GSE) as a solution to learn the optimal policy that covers both scenarios. In the proposed GSE framework, we introduce an individual utility function into the framework of value decomposition to consider the complex interactions between agents. \nThis function is capable of representing both the homogeneous and heterogeneous optimal policies. Furthermore, we utilize greedy marginal contribution calculated by the utility function as the credit value of the sequential execution policy to address the credit assignment and relative over-generalization problem. We evaluated GSE in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. The results demonstrate that GSE achieves significant improvement in performance across multiple domains, especially in scenarios involving both homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/e91e10a20d5e17ec8a9a469f872e7d0ec680cb37.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/7e9be8b7a794a18e534aae22eb9529c2452ec7c9.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nliu2024solving,\ntitle={Solving Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Cooperative Tasks with Greedy Sequential Execution},\nauthor={Shanqi Liu and Dong Xing and Pengjie Gu and Xinrun Wang and Bo An and Yong Liu},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=hB2hXtxIPH}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "liu|solving_homogeneous_and_heterogeneous_cooperative_tasks_with_greedy_sequential_execution"}}, "number": 7432, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7432/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7432/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7432/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695473426000, "cdate": 1695473426000, "tmdate": 1713672360377, "mdate": 1713672360377, "pdate": 1705411009539, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 20, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "reinforcement learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "Xkf2EBj4w3", "forum": "Xkf2EBj4w3", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7416/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7416/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Stabilizing Contrastive RL: Techniques for Robotic Goal Reaching from Offline Data"}, "authors": {"value": ["Chongyi Zheng", "Benjamin Eysenbach", "Homer Rich Walke", "Patrick Yin", "Kuan Fang", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov", "Sergey Levine"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Chongyi_Zheng1", "~Benjamin_Eysenbach1", "~Homer_Rich_Walke1", "~Patrick_Yin1", "~Kuan_Fang3", "~Ruslan_Salakhutdinov1", "~Sergey_Levine1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["reinforcement learning", "self-supervised learning", "contrastive learning", "goal-conditioned RL", "offline RL", "robotics"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Robotic systems that rely primarily on self-supervised learning have the potential to decrease the amount of human annotation and engineering effort required to learn control strategies.

However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowd workers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations.\n\nCode is available at https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/safe-rlhf.\n\n\nWarning: This paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/4db509db9de557fb05dd265958739cb86ea87827.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/b217a456a924d098f0a67e06e943ad2a9a18a040.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\ndai2024safe,\ntitle={Safe {RLHF}: Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback},\nauthor={Josef Dai and Xuehai Pan and Ruiyang Sun and Jiaming Ji and Xinbo Xu and Mickel Liu and Yizhou Wang and Yaodong Yang},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=TyFrPOKYXw}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "dai|safe_rlhf_safe_reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback"}}, "number": 7372, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7372/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7372/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7372/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695470439334, "cdate": 1695470439334, "tmdate": 1713328885039, "mdate": 1713328885039, "pdate": 1705411007480, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 26, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "reinforcement learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "wprSv7ichW", "forum": "wprSv7ichW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7354/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7354/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Benchmarking Algorithms for Federated Domain Generalization"}, "authors": {"value": ["Ruqi Bai", "Saurabh Bagchi", "David I.

Towards this objective, we introduce a novel data partition method that allows us to distribute any domain dataset among few or many clients while controlling client heterogeneity. We then introduce and apply our methodology to evaluate 14 DG methods, which include centralized DG methods adapted to the FL context, FL methods that handle client heterogeneity, and methods designed specifically for Federated DG on 7 datasets. Our results suggest that, despite some progress, significant performance gaps remain in Federated DG, especially when evaluating with a large number of clients, high client heterogeneity, or more realistic datasets.

Imitation learning (IL) utilizes oracles to improve sample efficiency, yet it is often constrained by the quality of the oracles deployed. To address the demand for robust policy improvement in real-world scenarios, we introduce a novel algorithm, Robust Policy Improvement (RPI), which actively interleaves between IL and RL based on an online estimate of their performance. RPI draws on the strengths of IL, using oracle queries to facilitate exploration\u2014an aspect that is notably challenging in sparse-reward RL\u2014particularly during the early stages of learning. As learning unfolds, RPI gradually transitions to RL, effectively treating the learned policy as an improved oracle. This algorithm is capable of learning from and improving upon a diverse set of black-box oracles. Integral to RPI are Robust Active Policy Selection (RAPS) and Robust Policy Gradient (RPG), both of which reason over whether to perform state-wise imitation from the oracles or learn from its own value function when the learner\u2019s performance surpasses that of the oracles in a specific state. Empirical evaluations and theoretical analysis validate that RPI excels in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methodologies, demonstrating superior performance across various benchmark

important research challenge offering avenues for integration into human-centric infrastructures and enabling physics-driven humanoid animations.\nThe daunting challenges in this field stem from the difficulty of optimizing in high-dimensional action spaces and the instability introduced by the bipedal morphology of humanoids. \nHowever, the extensive collection of human motion-captured data and the derived datasets of humanoid trajectories, such as MoCapAct, paves the way to tackle these challenges. In this context, we present Humanoid Generalist Autoencoding Planner (H-GAP), a state-action trajectory generative model trained on humanoid trajectories derived from human motion-captured data, capable of adeptly handling downstream control tasks with Model Predictive Control (MPC).\nFor 56 degrees of freedom humanoid, we empirically demonstrate that H-GAP learns to represent and generate a wide range of motor behaviors. Further, without any learning from online interactions, it can also flexibly transfer these behaviours to solve novel downstream control tasks via planning. Notably, H-GAP excels established MPC baselines with access to the ground truth model, and is superior or comparable to offline RL methods trained for individual tasks.\nFinally, we do a series of

novelty-based exploration that estimates visitation counts for clusters of states based on their similarity in a chosen embedding space. By adapting classical clustering to the nonstationary setting of Deep RL, RECODE can efficiently track state visitation counts over thousands of episodes. We further propose a novel generalization of the inverse dynamics loss, which leverages masked transformer architectures for multi-step prediction; which in conjunction with \\DETOCS achieves a new state-of-the-art in a suite of challenging 3D-exploration tasks in DM-Hard-8. RECODE also sets new state-of-the-art in hard exploration Atari games, and is the first agent to reach the end screen in \"Pitfall!\""}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"},

attention due to its high inference efficiency.\nHowever, training such operators requires generating a substantial amount of labeled data, i.e., PDE problems together with their solutions.\nThe data generation process is exceptionally time-consuming, as it involves solving numerous systems of linear equations to obtain numerical solutions to the PDEs.\nMany existing methods solve these systems independently without considering their inherent similarities, resulting in extremely redundant computations.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose a novel method, namely **S**orting **K**rylov **R**ecycling (**SKR**), to boost the efficiency of solving these systems, thus significantly accelerating data generation for neural operators training.\nTo the best of our knowledge, SKR is the first attempt to address the time-consuming nature of data generation for learning neural operators.\nThe working horse of SKR is Krylov subspace recycling, a powerful technique for solving a series of interrelated systems by leveraging their inherent similarities.\nSpecifically, SKR employs a sorting algorithm to arrange these systems in a sequence, where adjacent systems exhibit high similarities.\nThen it equips a solver with Krylov subspace recycling to solve the systems sequentially instead of independently, thus effectively enhancing the solving efficiency.\nBoth theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that SKR can significantly accelerate neural operator data generation, achieving a remarkable speedup of up to 13.9 times."}, "primary_area": {"value":

decision boundary has a hypersphere shape, which however is difficult to obtain in practice and is not sufficiently compact, especially when the data are in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we first propose a novel deep anomaly detection model that improves the original hypersphere learning through an orthogonal projection layer, which ensures that the training data distribution is consistent with the hypersphere hypothesis, thereby increasing the true positive rate and decreasing the false negative rate. Moreover, we propose a bi-hypersphere compression method to obtain a hyperspherical shell that yields a more compact decision region than a hyperball, which is demonstrated theoretically and numerically.  The proposed methods are not confined to common datasets such as image and tabular data, but are also extended to a more challenging but promising scenario, graph-level anomaly detection, which learns graph representation with maximum mutual information between the substructure and global structure features while exploring orthogonal single- or bi-hypersphere anomaly decision boundaries. The numerical and visualization results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods in comparison to many baselines and state-of-the-art methods."}, "primary_area": {"value": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/b8052c3c7a3cfeccc963ae2d0d24045831b4d84e.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/0fc6dd7a1e70242c23faf3056a487f5bc0724b4e.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nzhang2024deep,\ntitle={Deep Orthogonal Hypersphere Compression for Anomaly Detection},\nauthor={Yunhe Zhang and Yan Sun and Jinyu Cai and Jicong Fan},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=cJs4oE4m9Q}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "zhang|deep_orthogonal_hypersphere_compression_for_anomaly_detection"}}, "number": 7228, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7228/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7228/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7228/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695462338670, "cdate": 1695462338670, "tmdate": 1710815843331, "mdate": 1710815843331, "pdate": 1705411002872, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 14, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "JSS9rKHySk", "forum": "JSS9rKHySk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7145/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7145/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "On the Role of General Function Approximation in Offline Reinforcement Learning"}, "authors": {"value": ["Chenjie Mao", "Qiaosheng Zhang", "Zhen Wang", "Xuelong Li"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Chenjie_Mao1", "~Qiaosheng_Zhang2", "~Zhen_Wang11", "~Xuelong_Li2"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["reinforcement learning theory", "offline reinforcement learning", "general function approximation", "learnability", "minimax lower bounds"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "This paper clarifies the use of general function approximation in offline RL and proposes lower bounds for learnability."}, "abstract": {"value": "We study offline reinforcement learning (RL) with general function approximation. General function approximation is a powerful tool for algorithm design and analysis, but its adaptation to offline RL encounters several challenges due to varying approximation targets and assumptions that blur the real meanings of function assumptions. In this paper, we try to formulate and clarify the treatment of general function approximation in offline RL in two aspects: (1) analyzing different types of assumptions and their practical usage, and (2) understanding its role as a restriction on underlying MDPs from information-theoretic perspectives. Additionally, we introduce a new insight for lower bound establishing: one can exploit model-realizability to establish general-purpose lower bounds that can be generalized into other functions.

generalized cross validation (GCV) for estimating prediction risks of sketched ridge regression ensembles, enabling efficient and consistent tuning of regularization and sketching parameters. Our results hold for a broad class of asymptotically free sketches under very mild data assumptions. For squared prediction risk, we provide a decomposition into an unsketched equivalent implicit ridge bias and a sketching-based variance, and prove that the risk can be globally optimized by only tuning sketch size in infinite ensembles. For general subquadratic prediction risk functionals, we extend GCV to construct consistent risk estimators, and thereby obtain distributional convergence of the GCV-corrected predictions in Wasserstein-2 metric. This in particular allows construction of prediction intervals with asymptotically correct coverage conditional on the training data. We also propose an \"ensemble trick\" whereby the risk for unsketched ridge regression can be efficiently estimated via GCV using small sketched ridge ensembles.

The factual knowledge acquired during pretraining and instruction tuning can be useful in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, and language generation. Unlike conventional Knowledge Bases (KBs) that explicitly store factual knowledge, LLMs implicitly store facts in their parameters. Content generated by the LLMs can often exhibit inaccuracies or deviations from the truth, due to facts that can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. To this end, we aim to explore the extent and scope of factual knowledge within LLMs by designing the benchmark Pinocchio. Pinocchio contains 20K diverse factual questions that span different sources, timelines, domains, regions, and languages. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs can compose multiple facts, update factual knowledge temporally, reason over multiple pieces of facts, identify subtle factual differences, and resist adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on different sizes and types of LLMs show that existing LLMs still lack factual knowledge and suffer from various spurious correlations. We believe this is a critical bottleneck for realizing trustworthy artificial intelligence.

However, samples generated by these models often do not strictly comply with user-provided conditions. Due to this, there have been few attempts to evaluate this alignment via pre-trained scoring models to select well-generated samples. Nonetheless, current studies are confined to the text-to-image domain and require large training datasets. This suggests that crafting alignment scores for various conditions will demand considerable resources in the future. In this context, we introduce a universal condition alignment score that leverages the conditional probability measurable through the diffusion process. Our technique operates across all conditions and requires no additional models beyond the diffusion model used for generation, effectively enabling self-rejection.

However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8\\% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3\\% on \\mbox{ViT-B} models.

Recently, offline data mixing augmentation, e.g. handcrafted and saliency information-based mixup, has been gradually replaced by automatic mixing approaches. Through minimizing two sub-tasks, namely, mixed sample generation and mixup classification in an end-to-end way, AutoMix significantly improves accuracy on image classification tasks. However, as the optimization objective is consistent for the two sub-tasks, this approach is prone to generating consistent instead of diverse mixed samples, which results in overfitting for target task training. In this paper, we propose AdAutomixup, an adversarial automatic mixup augmentation approach that generates challenging samples to train a robust classifier for image classification, by alternatively optimizing the classifier and the mixup sample generator. AdAutomixup comprises two modules, a mixed example generator, and a target classifier. The mixed sample generator aims to produce hard mixed examples to challenge the target classifier, while the target classifier's aim is to learn robust features from hard mixed examples to improve generalization. To prevent the collapse of the inherent meanings of images, we further introduce an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher and cosine similarity to train AdAutomixup in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on seven image benchmarks consistently prove that our approach outperforms the state of the art in various classification scenarios.

While cognitive science emphasizes the significance of spatial context in the formation and retrieval of episodic memory, the current primary approach to implementing episodic memory in AI systems is through transformers that store temporally ordered experiences, which overlooks the spatial dimension. As a result, it is unclear how the underlying structure could be extended to incorporate the spatial axis beyond temporal order alone and thereby what benefits can be obtained. To address this, this paper explores the use of Spatially-Aware Transformer models that incorporate spatial information. These models enable the creation of place-centric episodic memory that considers both temporal and spatial dimensions. Adopting this approach, we demonstrate that memory utilization efficiency can be improved, leading to enhanced accuracy in various place-centric downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose the Adaptive Memory Allocator, a memory management method based on reinforcement learning that aims to optimize efficiency of memory utilization. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model in various environments and across multiple downstream tasks, including prediction, generation, reasoning, and reinforcement learning.

Whereas prior works have focused on leveraging LLMs directly for planning in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the search of task structures and constraints implicit in multi-step demonstrations. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, which group robot configurations by specific motion constraints, to serve as an abstraction layer between the high-level language representations of an LLM and the low-level physical trajectories of a robot. By replaying a few human demonstrations with synthetic perturbations, we generate coverage over the demonstrations' state space with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains an end-to-end differentiable neural network to predict successful trajectories from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states and images in mode families without dense labeling. The learned grounding classifiers can further be used to translate language plans into reactive policies in the physical domain in an interpretable manner. We show our approach improves the interpretability and reactivity of imitation learning through 2D navigation and simulated and real robot manipulation tasks.

Current approaches largely revolve around solving a minimax problem to prepare for potential worst-case scenarios. While effective against strong attacks, these methods often compromise performance in the absence of attacks or the presence of only weak attacks. To address this, we study policy robustness under the well-accepted state-adversarial attack model, extending our focus beyond merely worst-case attacks. We first formalize this task at test time as a regret minimization problem and establish its intrinsic difficulty in achieving sublinear regret when the baseline policy is from a general continuous policy class, $\\Pi$. This finding prompts us to \\textit{refine} the baseline policy class $\\Pi$ prior to test time, aiming for efficient adaptation within a compact, finite policy class $\\tilde{\\Pi}$, which can resort to an adversarial bandit subroutine.

Therefore, vanilla SMoE models are memory inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained downstream scenarios. In this paper, we ask: Can we craft a compact SMoE model by consolidating expert information? What is the best recipe to merge multiple experts into fewer but more knowledgeable experts? Our pilot investigation reveals that conventional model merging methods fail to be effective in such expert merging for SMoE. The potential reasons are: ($1$) redundant information overshadows critical experts; ($2$) appropriate neuron permutation for each expert is missing to bring all of them in alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel merging algorithm for SMoE, $\\textit{i.e.}$, $\\texttt{M-SMoE}$, which leverages routing statistics to guide expert merging. Specifically, it starts with neuron permutation alignment for experts; then, dominant experts and their \"group members\" are formed based on routing policies; lastly, every expert group is merged into a single expert by utilizing each expert's activation frequency as their weight for merging, thus diminishing the impact of insignificant experts. Moreover, we draw an interesting observation that our proposed merging promotes a low dimensionality in the merged expert's weight space, naturally paving the way for additional compression. Hence, our final method, $\\texttt{MC-SMoE}$ ($\\textit{i.e.}$, Merge, then Compress SMoE), further decomposes the merged experts into low-rank and structural sparse alternatives. Extensive experiments across $8$ benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposals.

To incorporate these inductive biases, we propose the Second-order Equivariant Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (SEGNO). Specifically, we show how the second-order continuity can be incorporated into GNNs while maintaining the equivariant property. Furthermore, we offer theoretical insights into SEGNO, highlighting that it can learn a unique trajectory between adjacent states, which is crucial for model generalization. Additionally, we prove that the discrepancy between this learned trajectory of SEGNO and the true trajectory is bounded.

(e.g., test error) and measuring graph data-level discrepancies, particularly when the training graph used for developing GNNs remains unobserved during test time.\nIn this paper, we study a new research problem, online GNN evaluation, which aims to provide valuable insights into the well-trained GNNs's ability to effectively generalize to real-world unlabeled graphs under the test-time graph distribution shifts.\nConcretely, we develop an effective learning behavior discrepancy score, dubbed LeBeD, to estimate the test-time generalization errors of well-trained GNN models. \nThrough a novel GNN re-training strategy with a parameter-free optimality criterion, the proposed LeBeD comprehensively integrates learning behavior discrepancies from both node prediction and structure reconstruction perspectives.\nThis enables the effective evaluation of the well-trained GNNs' ability to capture test node semantics and structural representations, making it an expressive metric for estimating the generalization error in online GNN evaluation.\nExtensive experiments on real-world test graphs under diverse graph distribution shifts could verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, revealing its strong correlation with ground-truth test errors on various well-trained GNN models."}, "primary_area": {"value": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised

However, pre-training data often contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model. This paper aims to understand the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and to mitigate its impact on downstream tasks. More specifically, through extensive experiments of supervised pre-training models on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K and YFCC15M datasets, we demonstrate that while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) transfer performance, where the training and testing data share the same distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing data distribution are different. We empirically verify that the reason behind is noise in pre-training shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a light-weight black-box tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization on both ID and OOD tasks, considering one may not be able to fully fine-tune or even access the pre-trained models. We conduct practical experiments on popular vision and language models that are pre-trained on noisy data for evaluation of our approach.

Specifically, we develop cross-modality attacks on alignment where we pair adversarial images going through the vision encoder with textual prompts to break the alignment of the language model. Our attacks employ a novel compositional strategy that combines an image, adversarially targeted towards toxic embeddings, with generic prompts to accomplish the jailbreak. Thus, the LLM draws the context to answer the generic prompt from the adversarial image. The generation of benign-appearing adversarial images leverages a novel embedding-space-based methodology, operating with no access to the LLM model. Instead, the attacks require access only to the vision encoder and utilize one of our four embedding space targeting strategies. By not requiring access to the LLM, the attacks lower the entry barrier for attackers, particularly when vision encoders such as CLIP are embedded in closed-source LLMs. The attacks achieve a high success rate across different VLMs, highlighting the risk of cross-modality alignment vulnerabilities, and the need for new alignment approaches for multi-modal models."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/73245653c0cb13379877051e65dbc93ef4aa85cd.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/35ff9ea0935ed48be01503d14fdd0b2dbabb0ad0.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nshayegani2024jailbreak,\ntitle={Jailbreak in pieces: Compositional Adversarial Attacks on Multi-Modal Language Models},\nauthor={Erfan Shayegani and Yue Dong and Nael Abu-Ghazaleh},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=plmBsXHxgR}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "shayegani|jailbreak_in_pieces_compositional_adversarial_attacks_on_multimodal_language_models"}}, "number": 6613, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6613/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6613/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6613/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695430607462, "cdate": 1695430607462, "tmdate": 1710179346282, "mdate": 1710179346282, "pdate": 1705410981152, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 23, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "GURqUuTebY", "forum": "GURqUuTebY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6601/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6601/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "DreamFlow: High-quality text-to-3D generation by Approximating Probability Flow"}, "authors": {"value": ["Kyungmin Lee", "Kihyuk Sohn", "Jinwoo Shin"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Kyungmin_Lee1", "~Kihyuk_Sohn1", "~Jinwoo_Shin1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Text-to-3D generation", "Diffusion model", "Score Distillation Sampling"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Recent progress in text-to-3D generation has been achieved through the utilization of score distillation methods: they make use of the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling via the diffusion model training objective. However, such an approach inevitably results in the use of random timesteps at each update, which increases the variance of the gradient and ultimately prolongs the optimization process. In this paper, we propose to enhance the text-to-3D optimization by leveraging the T2I diffusion prior in the generative sampling process with a predetermined timestep schedule. To this end, we interpret text-to-3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem, and propose a solution by approximating the probability flow. By leveraging the proposed novel optimization algorithm, we design DreamFlow, a practical three-stage coarse-to-fine text-to-3D optimization framework that enables fast generation of high-quality and high-resolution (i.e., 1024\u00d71024) 3D contents.

To address this shortcoming, we propose stack attention: an attention operator that incorporates stacks, inspired by their theoretical connections to context-free languages (CFLs). We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs. We show that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty.

In our environment, agents role-play and *interact* under a wide variety of scenarios; they coordinate, collaborate, exchange, and compete with each other to achieve complex social goals. We simulate the role-play interaction between LLM-based agents and humans within this task space and evaluate their performance with a holistic evaluation framework called SOTOPIA-Eval.

We call this phenomenon \u201csensory scaffolding\u201d: observation streams that are not needed by a master might yet aid a novice learner. We consider such sensory scaffolding setups for training artificial agents. For example, a robot arm may need to be deployed with just a low-cost, robust, general-purpose camera; yet its performance may improve by having privileged training-time-only access to informative albeit expensive and unwieldy motion capture rigs or fragile tactile sensors. For these settings, we propose \u201cScaffolder\u201d, a reinforcement learning approach which effectively exploits privileged sensing in critics, world models, reward estimators, and other such auxiliary components that are only used at training time, to improve the target policy. For evaluating sensory scaffolding agents, we design a new \u201cS3\u201d suite of ten diverse simulated robotic tasks that explore a wide range of practical sensor setups. Agents must use privileged camera sensing to train blind hurdlers, privileged active visual perception to help robot arms overcome visual occlusions, privileged touch sensors to train robot hands, and more.

In our work, we propose Error Norm Truncation (ENT), a robust enhancement method to the standard training objective that truncates noisy data. Compared to methods that only uses the negative log-likelihood loss to estimate data quality, our method provides a more accurate estimation by considering the distribution of non-target tokens, which is often overlooked by previous work. Through comprehensive experiments across language modeling, machine translation, and text summarization, we show that equipping text generation models with ENT improves generation quality over standard training and previous soft and hard truncation methods.

However, these approaches face significant challenges when extended to a wider variety of thin-shell materials and a diverse range of tasks.\nOn the other hand, while virtual simulations are shown to be effective in diverse robot skill learning and evaluation, prior thin-shell simulation environments only support a subset of thin-shell materials, which also limits their supported range of tasks. \nTo fill in this gap, we introduce ThinShellLab - a fully differentiable simulation platform tailored for robotic interactions with diverse thin-shell materials possessing varying material properties, enabling flexible thin-shell manipulation skill learning and evaluation. Building on top of our developed simulation engine, we design a diverse set of manipulation tasks centered around different thin-shell objects. Our experiments suggest that manipulating thin-shell objects presents several unique challenges: 1) thin-shell manipulation relies heavily on frictional forces due to the objects' co-dimensional nature, 2) the materials being manipulated are highly sensitive to minimal variations in interaction actions, and 3) the constant and frequent alteration in contact pairs makes trajectory optimization methods susceptible to local optima, and neither standard reinforcement learning algorithms nor trajectory optimization methods (either gradient-based or gradient-free) are able to solve the tasks alone. To overcome these challenges, we present an optimization scheme that couples sampling-based trajectory optimization and gradient-based optimization, boosting both learning efficiency and converged performance across various proposed tasks. In addition, the differentiable nature of our platform facilitates a smooth sim-to-real transition. By tuning simulation parameters with a minimal set of real-world data, we demonstrate successful deployment of the learned skills to real-robot settings.  ThinShellLab will be publicly available.

Our threat model assumes that an attack succeeds if the answer to a sensitive question is located among a set of B generated candidates, based on scenarios where the information would be insecure if the answer is among B candidates. Experimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods such as ROME struggle to truly delete factual information from models like GPT-J, as our whitebox and blackbox attacks can recover \u201cdeleted\u201d information from an edited model 38% of the time. These attacks leverage two key observations: (1) that traces of deleted information can be found in intermediate model hidden states, and (2) that applying an editing method for one question may not delete information across rephrased versions of the question. Finally, we provide new defense methods that protect against some extraction attacks, but we do not find a single universally effective defense method. Our results suggest that truly deleting sensitive information is a tractable but difficult problem, since even relatively low attack success rates have potentially severe implications for the deployment of language models in a world where individuals enjoy ownership of their personal data, a right to privacy, and safety from harmful model outputs."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/58461c89ea8f999b82924f883aa34b627914dc42.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/fb642952d68748c4c3da0a925fd0602ac68ae134.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\npatil2024can,\ntitle={Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted From {LLM}s?

Most prior work on L2R has focused on minimizing the standard misclassification error. However, in many real-world applications, the label distribution is highly imbalanced,  necessitating alternate evaluation metrics such as the balanced error or the worst-group error that enforce equitable performance across both the head and tail classes. In this paper, we establish that traditional L2R methods can be grossly sub-optimal for such metrics, and show that this is due to an intricate  dependence in the objective between the label costs and the rejector. We then derive the form of the Bayes-optimal classifier and rejector for the balanced error, propose a novel plug-in approach to mimic this solution, and extend our results to general evaluation metrics. Through experiments on benchmark  image classification tasks, we show that our approach yields better trade-offs in both the balanced and worst-group error compared to L2R baselines."}, "primary_area": {"value": "learning theory"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/2d19da352871db6a1e7954f4651e9b44594126b8.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nnarasimhan2024learning,\ntitle={Learning to Reject Meets Long-tail Learning},\nauthor={Harikrishna Narasimhan and Aditya Krishna Menon and Wittawat Jitkrittum and Neha Gupta and Sanjiv Kumar},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ta26LtNq2r}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "narasimhan|learning_to_reject_meets_longtail_learning"}}, "number": 6368, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6368/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6368/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695418806719, "cdate": 1695418806719, "tmdate": 1713672138706, "mdate": 1713672138706, "pdate": 1705410973784, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 20, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "learning theory", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "Tj3xLVuE9f", "forum": "Tj3xLVuE9f", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6363/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6363/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "On the Foundations of Shortcut Learning"}, "authors": {"value": ["Katherine Hermann", "Hossein Mobahi", "Thomas FEL", "Michael Curtis Mozer"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Katherine_Hermann1", "~Hossein_Mobahi2", "~Thomas_FEL1", "~Michael_Curtis_Mozer1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["shortcut learning", "spurious correlations", "architectural inductive bias"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Deep-learning models can extract a rich assortment of features from data. Which features a model uses depends not only on *predictivity*---how reliably a feature indicates training-set labels---but also on *availability*---how easily the feature can be extracted from inputs. The literature on shortcut learning has noted examples in which models privilege one feature over another, for example texture over shape and image backgrounds over foreground objects. Here, we test hypotheses about which input properties are more available to a model, and systematically study how predictivity and availability interact to shape models' feature use. We construct a minimal, explicit generative framework for synthesizing classification datasets with two latent features that vary in predictivity and in factors we hypothesize to relate to availability, and we quantify a model's shortcut bias---its over-reliance on the shortcut (more available, less predictive) feature at the expense of the core (less available, more predictive) feature. We find that linear models are relatively unbiased, but introducing a single hidden layer with ReLU or Tanh units yields a bias. Our empirical findings are consistent with a theoretical account based on Neural Tangent Kernels. Finally, we study how models used in practice trade off predictivity and availability in naturalistic datasets, discovering availability manipulations which increase models' degree of shortcut bias. Taken together, these findings suggest that the propensity to learn shortcut features is a fundamental characteristic of deep nonlinear architectures warranting systematic study given its role in shaping how models solve tasks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "visualization or interpretation of learned representations"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/3f47b29f0e35691e7047d9fbfa0e4c47ea966e49.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nhermann2024on,\ntitle={On the Foundations of Shortcut Learning},\nauthor={Katherine Hermann and Hossein Mobahi and Thomas FEL and Michael Curtis Mozer},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tj3xLVuE9f}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "hermann|on_the_foundations_of_shortcut_learning"}}, "number": 6363, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6363/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6363/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6363/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695418758228, "cdate": 1695418758228, "tmdate": 1710544298787, "mdate": 1710544298787, "pdate": 1705410973678, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 15, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "visualization or interpretation of learned representations", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "x5txICnnjC", "forum": "x5txICnnjC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6281/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6281/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Synaptic Weight Distributions Depend on the Geometry of Plasticity"}, "authors": {"value": ["Roman Pogodin", "Jonathan Cornford", "Arna Ghosh", "Gauthier Gidel", "Guillaume Lajoie", "Blake Aaron Richards"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Roman_Pogodin1", "~Jonathan_Cornford1", "~Arna_Ghosh1", "~Gauthier_Gidel1", "~Guillaume_Lajoie1", "~Blake_Aaron_Richards1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["synaptic weight distributions", "synaptic plasticity", "biologically plausible learning", "mirror descent"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "different algorithms result in different synaptic weight distributions, and the log-normal one is consistent with exponentiated gradient"}, "abstract": {"value": "A growing literature in computational neuroscience leverages gradient descent and learning algorithms that approximate it to study synaptic plasticity in the brain.

Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with non-Euclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning.

Consequently, many tasks can be unified by treating neural networks themselves as input data.

However, those works developed architectures tailored to specific networks such as MLPs and CNNs without normalization layers, and generalizing such architectures to other types of networks can be challenging. In this work, we overcome these challenges by building new metanetworks --- neural networks that take weights from other neural networks as input. Put simply, we carefully build graphs representing the input neural networks and process the graphs using graph neural networks. Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs), generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as multi-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet blocks, and group-equivariant linear layers.

This model is motivated by applications in online recommendation where the choice of recommended items depends on both the click-through rates and the post-click rewards. Like in classical bandits, rewards follow a fixed unknown distribution. However, we assume that the click-rate of each arm is chosen  strategically by the arm (e.g., a host on Airbnb)  in order to maximize  the number of times it gets clicked. The algorithm designer does not know the post-click rewards nor the arms' actions (i.e., strategically chosen click-rates) in advance, and must learn both values over time. To solve this problem, we design an incentive-aware learning algorithm, UCB-S, which achieves two goals simultaneously: (a) incentivizing desirable arm behavior under uncertainty; (b) minimizing regret by learning unknown parameters.  We approximately characterize all Nash equilibria of the arms under UCB-S and show a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}} (\\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound uniformly in every equilibrium. We also show that incentive-unaware algorithms generally fail to achieve low regret in the strategic click-bandit.

We study two types of settings: one where there is iid noise in the observation, and a more challenging setting where there is also the presence of exogenous noise, which is non-iid noise that is temporally correlated, such as the motion of people or cars in the background. We study three commonly used approaches: autoencoding, temporal contrastive learning, and forward modeling. We prove upper bounds for temporal contrastive learning and forward modeling in the presence of only iid noise. We show that these approaches can learn the latent state and use it to do efficient downstream RL with polynomial sample complexity. When exogenous noise is also present, we establish a lower bound result showing that the sample complexity of learning from video data can be exponentially worse than learning from action-labeled trajectory data.

Our results hold for an arbitrary distribution of the input samples and are based on giving the corresponding bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis/Natarajan dimension of the associated problems. We further show that the theoretical bounds on sample complexity obtained via VC/Natarajan dimension can have strong predictive power for experimental results, in contrast with the folklore belief about a substantial gap between the statistical learning theory and the practice of deep learning."}, "primary_area": {"value": "learning theory"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/00a6d5623a59e634ef01b7ebdd71bd1b30b22500.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/36c855234f04aea83e5509d335a3040d5b6ea1f8.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nalon2024optimal,\ntitle={Optimal Sample Complexity of Contrastive Learning},\nauthor={Noga Alon and Dmitrii Avdiukhin and Dor Elboim and Orr Fischer and Grigory Yaroslavtsev},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=NU9AYHJvYe}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "alon|optimal_sample_complexity_of_contrastive_learning"}}, "number": 6157, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6157/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6157/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6157/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "tcdate": 1695410627881, "cdate": 1695410627881, "tmdate": 1710465920896, "mdate": 1710465920896, "pdate": 1705410967233, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 12, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "learning theory", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "FM5xfcaR2Y", "forum": "FM5xfcaR2Y", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6102/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6102/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Post-hoc bias scoring is optimal for fair classification"}, "authors": {"value": ["Wenlong Chen", "Yegor Klochkov", "Yang Liu"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Wenlong_Chen1", "~Yegor_Klochkov2", "~Yang_Liu3"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["group fairness", "post-hoc fair classification", "Bayes optimal classifier", "accuracy-fairness trade-off"]}, "abstract": {"value": "We consider a binary classification problem under group fairness constraints, which can be one of Demographic Parity (DP), Equalized Opportunity (EOp), or Equalized Odds (EO).

Namely, we introduce a novel instance-level measure of bias, which we call bias score, and the modification rule is a simple linear rule on top of the finite amount of bias scores. Based on this characterization, we develop a post-hoc approach that allows us to adapt to fairness constraints while maintaining high accuracy. In the case of DP and EOp constraints, the modification rule is thresholding a single bias score, while in the case of EO constraints we are required to fit a linear modification rule with 2 parameters.

It includes the uncertainty of training initialization, algorithm and model architecture. To address this challenge, we propose a new strategy called **Sharpness-Aware Data Poisoning Attack (SAPA)**.

MIM applies random crops to input images, processes them with an encoder, and then recovers the masked inputs with a decoder, which encourages the network to capture and learn structural information about objects and scenes. The intermediate feature representations obtained from MIM are suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an Image Modeling framework based on random orthogonal projection instead of binary masking as in MIM. Our proposed Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling (ROPIM) reduces spatially-wise token information under guaranteed bound on the noise variance and can be considered as masking entire spatial image area under locally varying masking degrees. Since ROPIM uses a random subspace for the projection that realizes the masking step, the readily available complement of the subspace can be used during unmasking to promote recovery of removed information. In this paper, we show that using random orthogonal projection leads to superior performance compared to crop-based masking. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning"},

This paper studies a generic framework,\nwhere the unsupervised representation learning task is specified by an abstract class of latent variable models $\\Phi$ and the downstream task is specified by a class of prediction functions $\\Psi$.

However, datasets collected by humans in real-world environments are often noisy and may even be maliciously corrupted, which can significantly degrade the performance of offline RL. In this work, we first investigate the performance of current offline RL algorithms under comprehensive data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics. Our extensive experiments reveal that implicit Q-learning (IQL) demonstrates remarkable resilience to data corruption among various offline RL algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct both empirical and theoretical analyses to understand IQL's robust performance, identifying its supervised policy learning scheme as the key factor. Despite its relative robustness, IQL still suffers from heavy-tail targets of Q functions under dynamics corruption. To tackle this challenge, we draw inspiration from robust statistics to employ the Huber loss to handle the heavy-tailedness and utilize quantile estimators to balance penalization for corrupted data and learning stability. By incorporating these simple yet effective modifications into IQL, we propose a more robust offline RL approach named Robust IQL (RIQL).

In this paper, we have introduced 8 novel embodied question answering (EQA) tasks to develop learning models to comprehend embodied questions with multimodal expressions. We have developed a novel large-scale dataset, EQA-MX, with over 8 million diverse embodied QA data samples involving multimodal expressions from multiple visual and verbal perspectives. To learn salient multimodal representations from discrete verbal embeddings and continuous wrapping of multiview visual representations, we propose a vector-quantization (VQ) based multimodal representation learning model, VQ-Fusion, for the EQA tasks.

The inherent complexity of real-world data makes it unfeasible to exhaustively enumerate and encapsulate all its variations within a finite set of factors. However, it is worth noting that most real-world data have linguistic equivalents, typically in the form of textual descriptions. These linguistic counterparts can represent the data and effortlessly decomposed into distinct tokens. In light of this, we present Vocabulary Disentangled Retrieval (VDR), a retrieval-based framework that harnesses natural language as proxies of the underlying data variation to drive disentangled representation learning. Our approach employ a bi-encoder model to represent both data and natural language in a vocabulary space, enabling the model to distinguish dimensions that capture intrinsic characteristics within data through its natural language counterpart, thus facilitating disentanglement. We extensively assess the performance of VDR across 15 retrieval benchmark datasets, covering text-to-text and cross-modal retrieval scenarios, as well as human evaluation. Our experimental results compellingly demonstrate the superiority of VDR over previous bi-encoder retrievers with comparable model size and training costs, achieving an impressive 8.7% improvement in NDCG@10 on the BEIR benchmark, a 5.3\\% increase on MS COCO, and a 6.0% increase on Flickr30k in terms of mean recall in the zero-shot setting.

Based on this motivation, we present our ForgetNet, which does not use historical embeddings and thus is consistent with the Markov nature of the tasks. To address challenges in training ForgetNet at early stages, we further introduce G-ForgetNet, which uses a gating mechanism to allow for the selective integration of historical embeddings. Such an enhanced capability provides valuable computational pathways during the model's early training phase. Our extensive experiments, based on the CLRS-30 algorithmic reasoning benchmark, demonstrate that both ForgetNet and G-ForgetNet achieve better generalization capability than existing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of the gating mechanism, highlighting its degree of alignment with our intuitions and its effectiveness for robust performance.

To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\\%, 95.9\\%, and 88.1\\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Current bilevel optimization algorithms assume that the gradient of the upper-level function is Lipschitz (i.e., the upper-level function has a bounded smoothness parameter). However, recent studies reveal that certain neural networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs) exhibit potential unbounded smoothness, rendering conventional bilevel optimization algorithms unsuitable for these neural networks. In this paper, we design a new bilevel optimization algorithm, namely BO-REP, to address this challenge. This algorithm updates the upper-level variable using normalized momentum and incorporates two novel techniques for updating the lower-level variable: \\textit{initialization refinement} and \\textit{periodic updates}. Specifically, once the upper-level variable is initialized, a subroutine is invoked to obtain a refined estimate of the corresponding optimal lower-level variable, and the lower-level variable is updated only after every specific period instead of each iteration. When the upper-level problem is nonconvex and unbounded smooth, and the lower-level problem is strongly convex, we prove that our algorithm requires $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^4)$ \\footnote{Here $\\widetilde{O}(\\cdot)$ compresses logarithmic factors of $1/\\epsilon$ and $1/\\delta$, where $\\delta\\in(0,1)$ denotes the failure probability.} iterations to find an $\\epsilon$-stationary point in the stochastic setting, where each iteration involves calling a stochastic gradient or Hessian-vector product oracle. Notably, this result matches the state-of-the-art complexity results under the bounded smoothness setting and without mean-squared smoothness of the stochastic gradient, up to logarithmic factors. Our proof relies on novel technical lemmas for the periodically updated lower-level variable, which are of independent interest. Our experiments on hyper-representation learning, hyperparameter optimization, and data hyper-cleaning for text classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic refutation framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATE is non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations.

Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded \u201cprompt templates\u201d, i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transformation graphs, or imperative computational graphs where LMs are invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn how to apply compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric, by creating and collecting demonstrations. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, DSPy can automatically produce pipelines that outperform out-of-the-box few-shot prompting as well as expert-created demonstrations for GPT-3.5 and Llama2-13b-chat. On top of that, DSPy programs compiled for relatively small LMs like 770M parameter T5 and Llama2-13b-chat are competitive with many approaches that rely on large and proprietary LMs like GPT-3.5 and on expert-written prompt chains.

This is achieved through quadrature rules, which are weighted sums of utility functions evaluated from state samples obtained in discrete time. Our research reveals a critical yet underexplored phenomenon: the choice of the computational method -- in this case, the quadrature rule -- can significantly impact control performance. This impact is traced back to the fact that computational errors introduced in the PEV stage can affect the policy iteration's convergence behavior, which in turn affects the learned controller. To elucidate how computation impacts control, we draw a parallel between IntRL's policy iteration and Newton's method applied to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. In this light, computational error in PEV manifests as an extra error term in each iteration of Newton's method, with its upper bound proportional to the computational error. Further, we demonstrate that when the utility function resides in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the optimal quadrature is achievable by employing Bayesian quadrature with the RKHS-inducing kernel function. We prove that the local convergence rates for IntRL using the trapezoidal rule and Bayesian quadrature with a Mat\u00e9rn kernel to be $O(N^{-2})$ and $O(N^{-b})$, where $N$ is the number of evenly-spaced samples and $b$ is the Mat\u00e9rn kernel's smoothness parameter.

To this end, we conduct experiments that disentangle the effect of mask learning and parameter optimization and how both benefit from overparameterization. The ability of LRR to flip parameter signs early and stay robust to sign perturbations seems to make it not only more effective in mask identification but also in optimizing  diverse sets of masks, including random ones.

Conventional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn features that bridge labeled source and unlabeled target domains. In contrast to feature learning, gradual domain adaptation (GDA) leverages extra continuous intermediate domains with pseudo-labels to boost the source classifier. However, real intermediate domains are sometimes unavailable or ineffective. In this paper, we propose $\\textbf{G}$radual Domain Adaptation via $\\textbf{G}$radient $\\textbf{F}$low (GGF) to generate intermediate domains with preserving labels, thereby enabling us a fine-tuning method for GDA. We employ the Wasserstein gradient flow in Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence to transport samples from the source to the target domain. To simulate the dynamics, we utilize the Langevin algorithm.

One approach to mitigating this risk is to incorporate watermarking techniques into LLMs, allowing for the tracking and attribution of model outputs. This study examines a crucial aspect of watermarking: how significantly watermarks impact the quality of model-generated outputs. Previous studies have suggested a trade-off between watermark strength and output quality. However, our research demonstrates that it is possible to integrate watermarks without affecting the output probability distribution with appropriate implementation. We refer to this type of watermark as an unbiased watermark. This has significant implications for the use of LLMs, as it becomes impossible for users to discern whether a service provider has incorporated watermarks or not. Furthermore, the presence of watermarks does not compromise the performance of the model in downstream tasks, ensuring that the overall utility of the language model is preserved. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion around responsible AI development, suggesting that unbiased watermarks can serve as an effective means of tracking and attributing model outputs without sacrificing output quality."}, "primary_area": {"value": "generative models"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/fdb6b7b2517ce71ee9ed99a12175e4a0273d2b3f.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/f221b7b10e511ac76c89062cfb5ca17cdda3d379.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nhu2024unbiased,\ntitle={Unbiased Watermark for Large Language Models},\nauthor={Zhengmian Hu and Lichang Chen and Xidong Wu and Yihan Wu and Hongyang Zhang and Heng Huang},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=uWVC5FVidc}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "hu|unbiased_watermark_for_large_language_models"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5485/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5485/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410940577, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 21, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "generative models", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "EriR6Ec69a", "forum": "EriR6Ec69a", "number": 5484, "cdate": 1695388443633, "tcdate": 1695388443633, "mdate": 1709661521829, "tmdate": 1709661521829, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5484/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5484/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Leveraging Low-Rank and Sparse Recurrent Connectivity for Robust Closed-Loop Control"}, "authors": {"value": ["Neehal Tumma", "Mathias Lechner", "Noel Loo", "Ramin Hasani", "Daniela Rus"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Neehal_Tumma1", "~Mathias_Lechner1", "~Noel_Loo1", "~Ramin_Hasani1", "~Daniela_Rus1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Low-rank", "sparsity", "closed-loop", "recurrent neural networks"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "Low-rank and sparse recurrent matrices of RNNs can help generalization to closed-loop settings and distribution-shifts"}, "abstract": {"value": "Developing autonomous agents that can interact with changing environments is an open challenge in machine learning.

In this work, we explore the application of recurrent neural networks to tasks of this nature and understand how a parameterization of their recurrent connectivity influences robustness in closed-loop settings. Specifically, we represent the recurrent connectivity as a function of rank and sparsity and show both theoretically and empirically that modulating these two variables has desirable effects on network dynamics. The proposed low-rank, sparse connectivity induces an interpretable prior on the network that proves to be most amenable for a class of models known as closed-form continuous-time neural networks (CfCs).

CLIP models, particularly those incorporating vision transformers (ViTs), have exhibited remarkable generalization ability in zero-shot image classification. However, when transferring the vision-language alignment of CLIP from global image representation to local region representation for the open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, CLIP ViTs suffer from the domain shift from full images to local image regions. In this paper, we embark on an in-depth analysis of the region-language alignment in CLIP models, which is essential for downstream open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks. Subsequently, we propose an approach named CLIPSelf, which adapts the image-level recognition ability of CLIP ViT to local image regions without needing any region-text pairs. CLIPSelf empowers ViTs to distill itself by aligning a region representation extracted from its dense feature map with the image-level representation of the corresponding image crop. With the enhanced CLIP ViTs, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary object detection, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation across various benchmarks.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in text processing, prompting us to explore the capabilities of Large EEG Models (LEMs). We hope that LEMs can break through the limitations of different task types of EEG datasets, and obtain universal perceptual capabilities of EEG signals through unsupervised pre-training. Then the models can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks. However, compared to text data, the volume of EEG datasets is generally small and the format varies widely. For example, there can be mismatched numbers of electrodes, unequal length data samples, varied task designs, and low signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified foundation model for EEG called Large Brain Model (LaBraM). LaBraM enables cross-dataset learning by segmenting the EEG signals into EEG channel patches. Vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction is used to train a semantically rich neural tokenizer that encodes continuous raw EEG channel patches into compact neural codes. We then pre-train neural Transformers by predicting the original neural codes for the masked EEG channel patches. The LaBraMs were pre-trained on about 2,500 hours of various types of EEG signals from around 20 datasets and validated on multiple different types of downstream tasks. Experiments on abnormal detection, event type classification, emotion recognition, and gait prediction show that our LaBraM outperforms all compared SOTA methods in their respective fields.

This mechanism not only guarantees high model performance and easy implementation but also lends itself well to other molecular modeling tasks.

To derive the generalization bounds under this setting, our analysis necessitates a shift from the conventional time-invariant Gram matrix employed in the lazy training regime to a time-variant, distribution-dependent version. To this end, we provide a global lower bound on the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix under the mean-field regime. Besides, for the traceability of the dynamic of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, we establish the linear convergence of the empirical error and estimate the upper bound of the KL divergence over parameters distribution.

However, the end result\u2014a neural-network-based inference machine\u2014remains unchallenged. In this paper, we introduce a different type of solution in the longitudinal setting: a closed-form ordinary differential equation (ODE). While we still rely on continuous optimization to learn an ODE, the resulting inference machine is no longer a neural network. Doing so yields several advantages such as interpretability, irregular sampling, and a different set of identification assumptions. Above all, we consider the introduction of a completely new type of solution to be our most important contribution as it may spark entirely new innovations in treatment effects in general.

DICE-based methods impose state-action-level behavior constraint, which is an ideal choice for offline learning. However, they typically perform much worse than current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that solely use action-level behavior constraint. After revisiting DICE-based methods, we find there exist two gradient terms when learning the value function using true-gradient update: forward gradient (taken on the current state) and backward gradient (taken on the next state). Using forward gradient bears a large similarity to many offline RL methods, and thus can be regarded as applying action-level constraint. However, directly adding the backward gradient may degenerate or cancel out its effect if these two gradients have conflicting directions. To resolve this issue, we propose a simple yet effective modification that projects the backward gradient onto the normal plane of the forward gradient, resulting in an orthogonal-gradient update, a new learning rule for DICE-based methods. We conduct thorough theoretical analyses and find that the projected backward gradient brings state-level behavior regularization, which reveals the mystery of DICE-based methods: the value learning objective does try to impose state-action-level constraint, but needs to be used in a corrected way.

To this end, existing works learn non-transferable representations by reducing statistical dependence between the source and target domain. However, such statistical methods essentially neglect to distinguish between *styles* and *contents*, leading them to inadvertently fit (i) spurious correlation between *styles* and *labels*, and (ii) fake independence between *contents* and *labels*. Consequently, their performance will be limited when natural distribution shifts occur or malicious intervention is imposed. In this paper, we propose a novel method (dubbed as H-NTL) to understand and advance the NTL problem by introducing a causal model to separately model *content* and *style* as two latent factors, based on which we disentangle and harness them as guidances for learning non-transferable representations with intrinsically causal relationships. Speci\ufb01cally, to avoid fitting spurious correlation and fake independence, we propose a variational inference framework to disentangle the naturally mixed *content factors* and *style factors* under our causal model. Subsequently, based on dual-path knowledge distillation, we harness the disentangled two *factors* as guidances for non-transferable representation learning: (i) we constraint the source domain representations to fit *content factors* (which are the intrinsic cause of *labels*), and (ii) we enforce that the target domain representations fit *style factors* which barely can predict labels. As a result, the learned feature representations follow optimal untransferability toward the target domain and minimal negative influence on the source domain, thus enabling better NTL performance. Empirically, the proposed H-NTL signi\ufb01cantly outperforms competing methods by a large margin."}, "primary_area": {"value": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/4d359626d33d8cb2e10f6d1cf6728b805a2b5316.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nhong2024improving,\ntitle={Improving Non-Transferable Representation Learning by Harnessing Content and Style},\nauthor={Ziming Hong and Zhenyi Wang and Li Shen and Yu Yao and Zhuo Huang and Shiming Chen and Chuanwu Yang and Mingming Gong and Tongliang Liu},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=FYKVPOHCpE}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "hong|improving_nontransferable_representation_learning_by_harnessing_content_and_style"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5244/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5244/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5244/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410932686, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 15, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "vpJMJerXHU", "forum": "vpJMJerXHU", "number": 5228, "cdate": 1695376973403, "tcdate": 1695376973403, "mdate": 1711094465056, "tmdate": 1711094465056, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5228/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5228/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "ModernTCN: A Modern Pure Convolution Structure for General Time Series Analysis"}, "authors": {"value": ["Luo donghao", "wang xue"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Luo_donghao2", "~wang_xue3"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Time Series Analysis", "Deep Learning"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We take a seldom-explored way in time series community to successfully bring convolution back to time series analysis.

To bridge this gap between optimization and OOD generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by \"robustness\" in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better OOD guarantees for robust algorithms. It also provides a theoretical backing for \"flat minima leads to better OOD generalization\".

The growing demand and cost of experimental PPI assays require computational methods for efficient PPI prediction. While existing methods rely heavily on protein sequence for PPI prediction, it is the protein structure that is the key to determine the interactions. To take both protein modalities into account, we define the microenvironment of an amino acid residue by its sequence and structural contexts, which describe the surrounding chemical properties and geometric features. In addition, microenvironments defined in previous work are largely based on experimentally assayed physicochemical properties, for which the \"vocabulary\" is usually extremely small. This makes it difficult to cover the diversity and complexity of microenvironments. In this paper, we propose Microenvironment-Aware Protein Embedding for PPI prediction (MPAE-PPI), which encodes microenvironments into chemically meaningful discrete codes via a sufficiently large microenvironment \"vocabulary\" (i.e., codebook). Moreover, we propose a novel pre-training strategy, namely Masked Codebook Modeling (MCM), to capture the dependencies between different microenvironments by randomly masking the codebook and reconstructing the input. With the learned microenvironment codebook, we can reuse it as an off-the-shelf tool to efficiently and effectively encode proteins of different sizes and functions for large-scale PPI prediction.

Unfortunately, global stability guarantees are hard to provide in dynamical systems learned from data, especially when the learned dynamics are governed by neural networks. We propose a novel methodology to learn \\emph{neural contractive dynamical systems}, where our neural architecture ensures contraction, and hence, global stability. To efficiently scale the method to high-dimensional dynamical systems, we develop a variant of the variational autoencoder that learns dynamics in a low-dimensional latent representation space while retaining contractive stability after decoding. We further extend our approach to learning contractive systems on the Lie group of rotations to account for full-pose end-effector dynamic motions. The result is the first highly flexible learning architecture that provides contractive stability guarantees with capability to perform obstacle avoidance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach encodes the desired dynamics more accurately than the current state-of-the-art, which provides less strong stability guarantees."}, "primary_area": {"value": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/a89591eec311a0efbd01f7135555a21d2d682c1c.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/58947be005497ff04d158bb31e64b18f6186222b.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nmohammadi2024neural,\ntitle={Neural Contractive Dynamical Systems},\nauthor={Hadi Beik Mohammadi and S{\\o}ren Hauberg and Georgios Arvanitidis and Nadia Figueroa and Gerhard Neumann and Leonel Rozo},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=iAYIRHOYy8}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "mohammadi|neural_contractive_dynamical_systems"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5107/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5107/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5107/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410927374, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 20, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "Tzh6xAJSll", "forum": "Tzh6xAJSll", "number": 5072, "cdate": 1695371744750, "tcdate": 1695371744750, "mdate": 1710533766557, "tmdate": 1710533766557, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5072/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5072/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Scaling Laws for Associative Memories"}, "authors": {"value": ["Vivien Cabannes", "Elvis Dohmatob", "Alberto Bietti"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Vivien_Cabannes1", "~Elvis_Dohmatob1", "~Alberto_Bietti1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["scaling law", "associative memory", "mechanistic interpretability", "Hopfield network"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "Mechanistic interpretability of memorization (modeling transformer intermediate layers)"}, "abstract": {"value": "Learning arguably involves the discovery and memorization of abstract rules.

To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a data-free framework that automates the generation and shaping of dense reward functions based on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural language, Text2Reward generates shaped dense reward functions as an executable program grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes or unshaped dense rewards with a constant function across timesteps, Text2Reward produces interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks, utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback. We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2, MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17 manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real world. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their reward functions with human feedback.

More broadly, we hope that the proposed Intra-Fusion approach invigorates exploration into a fresh alternative to the predominant compression approaches.\nOur code is available [here](https://github.com/alexandertheus/Intra-Fusion)."}, "primary_area": {"value": "general machine learning (i.e., none of the above)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/07560e42af2e42df14ac71025723b0b97a0924dd.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/f3880bade5a956d1464267f23a17af22bb840fb2.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\ntheus2024towards,\ntitle={Towards Meta-Pruning via Optimal Transport},\nauthor={Alexander Theus and Olin Geimer and Friedrich Wicke and Thomas Hofmann and Sotiris Anagnostidis and Sidak Pal Singh},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=sMoifbuxjB}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "theus|towards_metapruning_via_optimal_transport"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4946/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4946/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4946/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410922671, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 14, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "general machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "MLBdiWu4Fw", "forum": "MLBdiWu4Fw", "number": 4917, "cdate": 1695367201861, "tcdate": 1695367201861, "mdate": 1713099671200, "tmdate": 1713099671200, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4917/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4917/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "InternVid: A Large-scale Video-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation"}, "authors": {"value": ["Yi Wang", "Yinan He", "Yizhuo Li", "Kunchang Li", "Jiashuo Yu", "Xin Ma", "Xinhao Li", "Guo Chen", "Xinyuan Chen", "Yaohui Wang", "Ping Luo", "Ziwei Liu", "Yali Wang", "Limin Wang", "Yu Qiao"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Yi_Wang19", "~Yinan_He1", "~Yizhuo_Li1", "~Kunchang_Li1", "~Jiashuo_Yu1", "~Xin_Ma3", "~Xinhao_Li1", "~Guo_Chen2", "~Xinyuan_Chen1", "~Yaohui_Wang1", "~Ping_Luo2", "~Ziwei_Liu1", "~Yali_Wang1", "~Limin_Wang1", "~Yu_Qiao1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["video-language dataset", "video understanding", "video generation", "multimodal understanding", "action recognition", "video retrieval"]}, "abstract": {"value": "This paper introduces InternVid, a large-scale video-centric multimodal dataset that enables learning powerful and transferable video-text representations for multimodal understanding and generation.

However, in the real-world where test ground truths are not provided, it is non-trivial to find out whether bounding boxes are accurate, thus preventing us from assessing the detector generalization ability. In this work, we find under feature map dropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not change much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable position changes. We compute the box stability score (BS score) to reflect this stability. Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of bounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout. To obtain BS score, we use bipartite matching to find the corresponding boxes between the two sets and compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) across the entire test set. We contribute to finding that BS score has a strong, positive correlation with detection accuracy measured by mean average precision (mAP) under various test environments.

Modalities like electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging provide distinct views to the brain dynamics due to diametral spatiotemporal sensitivities and underlying neurophysiological coupling mechanisms. These distinct views pose a considerable challenge to learning a shared representation space, especially when dealing with covariance-based data characterized by their geometric structure. To capitalize on the geometric structure, we introduce a measure called geodesic correlation which expands traditional correlation consistency to covariance-based data on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. This measure is derived from classical canonical correlation analysis and serves to evaluate the consistency of latent representations obtained from paired views. For multi-view, self-supervised learning where one or both latent views are SPD we propose an innovative geometric deep learning framework termed DeepGeoCCA. Its primary objective is to enhance the geodesic correlation of unlabeled, paired data, thereby generating novel representations while retaining the geometric structures. In simulations and experiments with multi-view and multi-modal human neuroimaging data, we find that DeepGeoCCA learns latent representations with high geodesic correlation for unseen data while retaining relevant information for downstream tasks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/4ccf9cac26244e14e3fd2742852e226018c0e4b8.pdf"}, "TLDR": {"value": "A geometric deep learning-based approach to learn the SPD matrix-valued latent representation for paired covariance-based neuroimaging modalities under the self-supervised learning framework."}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nju2024deep,\ntitle={Deep Geodesic Canonical Correlation Analysis for Covariance-Based Neuroimaging Data},\nauthor={Ce Ju and Reinmar J Kobler and Liyao Tang and Cuntai Guan and Motoaki Kawanabe},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=PnR1MNen7u}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "ju|deep_geodesic_canonical_correlation_analysis_for_covariancebased_neuroimaging_data"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4904/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4904/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4904/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410921397, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 19, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "tveiUXU2aa", "forum": "tveiUXU2aa", "number": 4897, "cdate": 1695366302606, "tcdate": 1695366302606, "mdate": 1713672130199, "tmdate": 1713672130199, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4897/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4897/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "SWAP-NAS: Sample-Wise Activation Patterns for Ultra-fast NAS"}, "authors": {"value": ["Yameng Peng", "Andy Song", "Haytham M.

Hence, we propose Sample-Wise Activation Patterns and its derivative, SWAP-Score, a novel high-performance training-free metric. It measures the expressivity of networks over a batch of input samples. The SWAP-Score is strongly correlated with ground-truth performance across various search spaces and tasks, outperforming 15 existing training-free metrics on NAS-Bench-101/201/301 and TransNAS-Bench-101. The SWAP-Score can be further enhanced by regularisation, which leads to even higher correlations in cell-based search space and enables model size control during the search. For example, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient between regularised SWAP-Score and CIFAR-100 validation accuracies on NAS-Bench-201 networks is 0.90, significantly higher than 0.80 from the second-best metric, NWOT.

While recently proposed approaches show promise in generalization to novel objects, semantic concepts, or visual distribution shifts, generalization to new tasks remains challenging. For example, a language-conditioned policy trained on pick-and-place tasks will not be able to generalize to a folding task, even if the arm trajectory of folding is similar to pick-and-place. Our key insight is that this kind of generalization becomes feasible if we represent the task through rough trajectory sketches. We propose a policy conditioning method using such rough trajectory sketches, which we call RT-Trajectory, that is practical, easy to specify, and allows the policy to effectively perform new tasks that would otherwise be challenging to perform. We find that trajectory sketches strike a balance between being detailed enough to express low-level motion-centric guidance while being coarse enough to allow the learned policy to interpret the trajectory sketch in the context of situational visual observations. In addition, we show how trajectory sketches can provide a useful interface to communicate with robotic policies -- they can be specified through simple human inputs like drawings or videos, or through automated methods such as modern image-generating or waypoint-generating methods. We evaluate RT-Trajectory at scale on a variety of real-world robotic tasks, and find that RT-Trajectory is able to perform a wider range of tasks compared to language-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, when provided the same training data."}, "primary_area": {"value": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of

In this paper, we develop NaturalSpeech 2, a TTS system that leverages a neural audio codec with residual vector quantizers to get the quantized latent vectors and uses a diffusion model to generate these latent vectors conditioned on text input. To enhance the zero-shot capability that is important to achieve diverse speech synthesis, we design a speech prompting mechanism to facilitate in-context learning in the diffusion model and the duration/pitch predictor. We scale NaturalSpeech 2 to large-scale datasets with 44K hours of speech and singing data and evaluate its voice quality on unseen speakers. NaturalSpeech 2 outperforms previous TTS systems by a large margin in terms of prosody/timbre similarity, robustness, and voice quality in a zero-shot setting, and performs novel zero-shot singing synthesis with only a speech prompt.

In many important applications, such as coverage control, experiment design and informative path planning, rewards naturally have diminishing returns, i.e., their value decreases in light of similar states visited previously. To tackle this, we propose Submodular RL (subRL), a paradigm which seeks to optimize more general, non-additive (and history-dependent) rewards modelled via submodular set functions, which capture diminishing returns. Unfortunately, in general, even in tabular settings, we show that the resulting optimization problem is hard to approximate. On the other hand, motivated by the success of greedy algorithms in classical submodular optimization, we propose subPO, a simple policy gradient-based algorithm for subRL that handles non-additive rewards by greedily maximizing marginal gains. Indeed, under some assumptions on the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), subPO recovers optimal constant factor approximations of submodular bandits.

In this work, we critically analyze this approach of imitating language models. We first finetune a series of LMs that imitate ChatGPT using varying base model sizes (1.5B--13B), data sources, and imitation data amounts (0.3M--150M tokens). We then evaluate the models using crowd raters and canonical NLP benchmarks. Initially, we were surprised by the output quality of our imitation models---they appear far better at following instructions, and crowd workers rate their outputs as competitive with ChatGPT. However, when conducting more targeted automatic evaluations, we find that imitation models close little to none of the gap from the base LM to ChatGPT on tasks that are not heavily supported in the imitation data. We show that these performance discrepancies may slip past human raters because imitation models are adept at mimicking ChatGPT\u2019s style but not its factuality. Overall, we conclude that while model imitation can be useful for training models to follow instructions and avoid toxic outputs, it falls short its full promise in many ways. In particular, there exists a substantial capabilities gap between open and closed LMs that we find cannot be bridged merely by adding more imitation data. Instead, we find that fine-tuning more capable base LMs has a significantly more substantial effect on closing this gap. In turn, we argue that the higher leverage action for improving open-source models is to tackle the difficult challenge of developing better base LMs, rather than taking the shortcut of imitating proprietary systems."}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/b4739f190faa45d202f9d7847e19ebde7844eb25.pdf"}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\ngudibande2024the,\ntitle={The False Promise of Imitating Proprietary Language Models},\nauthor={Arnav Gudibande and Eric Wallace and Charlie Victor Snell and Xinyang Geng and Hao Liu and Pieter Abbeel and Sergey Levine and Dawn Song},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Kz3yckpCN5}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "gudibande|the_false_promise_of_imitating_proprietary_language_models"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4752/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4752/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410917255, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 19, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "Tr3fZocrI6", "forum": "Tr3fZocrI6", "number": 4744, "cdate": 1695360627756, "tcdate": 1695360627756, "mdate": 1713181808893, "tmdate": 1713181808893, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4744/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4744/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Sample-Efficient Linear Representation Learning from Non-IID Non-Isotropic Data"}, "authors": {"value": ["Thomas TCK Zhang", "Leonardo Felipe Toso", "James Anderson", "Nikolai Matni"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Thomas_TCK_Zhang1", "~Leonardo_Felipe_Toso1", "~James_Anderson6", "~Nikolai_Matni2"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Representation learning", "meta learning", "multi-task learning"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "Existing representation learning methods induce biases even in linear settings, which throttle sample-efficiency in learning over many tasks.

Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of recovering linear operators $M$\nfrom noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$, where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic meta-learning approaches incur biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, $\\texttt{De-bias}$ & $\\texttt{Feature-Whiten}$ ($\\texttt{DFW}$), of the popular alternating minimization-descent (AMD) scheme proposed in Collins et al., (2021), and establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level scaling down with the $\\textit{total}$ source data size.

challenging task of nighttime optical flow, which suffers from weakened texture and amplified noise. These degradations weaken discriminative visual features, thus causing invalid motion feature matching. Typically, existing methods employ domain adaptation to transfer knowledge from auxiliary domain to nighttime domain in either input visual space or output motion space. However, this direct adaptation is ineffective, since there exists a large domain gap due to the intrinsic heterogeneous nature of the feature representations between auxiliary and nighttime domains. To overcome this issue, we explore a common-latent space as the intermediate bridge to reinforce the feature alignment between auxiliary and nighttime domains. In this work, we exploit two auxiliary daytime and event domains, and propose a novel common appearance-boundary adaptation framework for nighttime optical flow. In appearance adaptation, we employ the intrinsic image decomposition to embed the auxiliary daytime image and the nighttime image into a reflectance-aligned common space. We discover that motion distributions of the two reflectance maps are very similar, benefiting us to consistently transfer motion appearance knowledge from daytime to nighttime domain. In boundary adaptation, we theoretically derive the motion correlation formula between nighttime image and accumulated events within a spatiotemporal gradient-aligned common space. We figure out that the correlation of the two spatiotemporal gradient maps shares significant discrepancy, benefitting us to contrastively transfer boundary knowledge from event to nighttime domain. Moreover, appearance adaptation and boundary adaptation are complementary to each other, since they could jointly transfer global motion and local boundary knowledge to the nighttime domain. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method."}, "primary_area": {"value": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/e3328346222dfff5580d6899ec8ffbac04ef6de9.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/135190ac7fe30de3e806610e290c0c8d4bd76b47.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nzhou2024exploring,\ntitle={Exploring the Common Appearance-Boundary Adaptation for Nighttime Optical Flow},\nauthor={Hanyu Zhou and Yi Chang and Haoyue Liu and YAN WENDING and Yuxing Duan and Zhiwei Shi and Luxin Yan},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=776lhoaulC}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "zhou|exploring_the_common_appearanceboundary_adaptation_for_nighttime_optical_flow"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4688/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4688/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410914793, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 18, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "6N8TW504aa", "forum": "6N8TW504aa", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4675/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4675/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Graphical Multioutput Gaussian Process with Attention"}, "authors": {"value": ["Yijue Dai", "Wenzhong Yan", "Feng Yin"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Yijue_Dai1", "~Wenzhong_Yan1", "~Feng_Yin1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Gaussian process regression", "Multioutput Gaussian process", "Attention mechanism"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Integrating information while recognizing dependence from multiple data sources and enhancing the predictive performance of the multi-output regression are challenging tasks.

space, warping and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps.\nSoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles.\nIn experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing state-of-the-art performance.\nCode is available at this repository: https://github.com/seunghan96/softclt."}, "primary_area": {"value":

fairness, is an important consideration in the context of machine learning systems. The most commonly adopted group fairness-enhancing techniques are in-processing methods that rely on a mixture of a fairness objective (e.g., demographic parity) and a task-specific objective (e.g., cross-entropy) during the training process. However, when data arrives in an online fashion \u2013 one instance at a time \u2013 optimizing such fairness objectives poses several challenges. In particular, group fairness objectives are defined using expectations of predictions across different demographic groups. In the online setting, where the algorithm has access to a single instance at a time, estimating the group fairness objective requires additional storage and significantly more computation (e.g., forward/backward passes) than the task-specific objective at every time step. In this paper, we propose Aranyani, an ensemble of oblique decision trees, to make fair decisions in online settings. The hierarchical tree structure of Aranyani enables parameter isolation and allows us to efficiently compute the fairness gradients using aggregate statistics of previous decisions, eliminating the need for additional storage and forward/backward passes. We also present an efficient framework to train Aranyani and theoretically analyze several of its properties. We conduct empirical evaluations on 5 publicly available benchmarks (including vision and language datasets) to show that Aranyani achieves a better accuracy-fairness trade-off compared to baseline approaches."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/a8b785960a7be6f38289cdad3923ad1ba27c3a26.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/8eb45efc5607d8b3f57dd16341f441fd74d25685.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nchowdhury2024enhancing,\ntitle={Enhancing Group Fairness in Online Settings Using Oblique Decision Forests},\nauthor={Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury and Nicholas Monath and Ahmad Beirami and Rahul Kidambi and Kumar Avinava Dubey and Amr Ahmed and Snigdha Chaturvedi},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=E1NxN5QMOE}\n}"}, "TLDR": {"value": "We present an fairness algorithm, Aranyani, to achieve group fairness when data instances arrive one at a time in an online setting."}, "paperhash": {"value": "chowdhury|enhancing_group_fairness_in_online_settings_using_oblique_decision_forests"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4635/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4635/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4635/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410912318, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 28, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "CdjnzWsQax", "forum": "CdjnzWsQax", "number": 4634, "cdate": 1695356079484, "tcdate": 1695356079484, "mdate": 1713156632870, "tmdate": 1713156632870, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4634/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Generative Learning for Financial Time Series with Irregular and Scale-Invariant Patterns"}, "authors": {"value": ["Hongbin Huang", "Minghua Chen", "Xiao Qiao"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Hongbin_Huang1", "~Minghua_Chen1", "~Xiao_Qiao1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["generative model", "time series pattern recognition", "diffusion model", "financial time series"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Limited data availability poses a major obstacle in training deep learning models for financial applications. Synthesizing financial time series to augment real-world data is challenging due to the irregular and scale-invariant patterns uniquely associated with financial time series - temporal dynamics that repeat with varying duration and magnitude. Such dynamics cannot be captured by existing approaches, which often assume regularity and uniformity in the underlying data. We develop a novel generative framework called FTS-Diffusion to model irregular and scale-invariant patterns that consists of three modules. First, we develop a scale-invariant pattern recognition algorithm to extract recurring patterns that vary in duration and magnitude. Second, we construct a diffusion-based generative network to synthesize segments of patterns. Third, we model the temporal transition of patterns in order to aggregate the generated segments. Extensive experiments show that FTS-Diffusion generates synthetic financial time series highly resembling observed data, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives. Two downstream experiments demonstrate that augmenting real-world data with synthetic data generated by FTS-Diffusion reduces the error of stock market prediction by up to 17.9%.

Previous works proposed methods to detect these AI-generated texts, including simple ML classifiers, pretrained-model-based zero-shot methods, and finetuned language classification models. However, mainstream detectors always fail on short texts, like SMSes, Tweets, and reviews. In this paper, a Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled (MPU) training framework is proposed to address the difficulty of short-text detection without sacrificing long-texts. Firstly, we acknowledge the human-resemblance property of short machine texts, and rephrase AI text detection as a partial Positive-Unlabeled (PU) problem by regarding these short machine texts as partially \"unlabeled\". Then in this PU context, we propose the length-sensitive Multiscale PU Loss, where a recurrent model in abstraction is used to estimate positive priors of scale-variant corpora. Additionally, we introduce a Text Multiscaling module to enrich training corpora. Experiments show that our MPU method augments detection performance on long AI-generated texts, and significantly improves short-text detection of language model detectors. Language Models trained with MPU could outcompete existing detectors on various short-text and long-text detection benchmarks.

Existing works aiming at addressing this problem are usually based on global variance reduction, which requires a substantial amount of additional memory in a multiplicative factor equal to the total number of clients. An important open problem is to find a lightweight method for FL in the presence of clients with unknown participation rates. In this paper, we address this problem by adapting the aggregation weights in federated averaging (FedAvg) based on the participation history of each client. We first show that, with heterogeneous participation statistics, FedAvg with non-optimal aggregation weights can diverge from the optimal solution of the original FL objective, indicating the need of finding optimal aggregation weights. However, it is difficult to compute the optimal weights when the participation statistics are unknown. To address this problem, we present a new algorithm called FedAU, which improves FedAvg by adaptively weighting the client updates based on online estimates of the optimal weights without knowing the statistics of client participation.

Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, setting up the environment for each test scenario manually, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tail risks. To address these challenges, we introduce ToolEmu: a framework that uses an LM to emulate tool execution and enables scalable testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios. Alongside the emulator, we develop an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. We test both the tool emulator and evaluator through human evaluation and find that 68.8% of failures identified with ToolEmu would be valid real-world agent failures. Using our curated initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes toolkits and 144 test cases, we provide a quantitative risk analysis of current LM agents and identify numerous failures with potentially severe outcomes. Notably, even the safest LM agent exhibits such failures 23.9% of the time according to our evaluator, underscoring the need to develop safer LM agents for real-world deployment."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/d1601f78407737fc216de9e6ec0085038f8c885f.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/85c23fd1fde464458191316b3a00a952a1543d90.zip"}, "TLDR": {"value": "An LM-based emulation framework for identifying the risks of LM agents at scale"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nruan2024identifying,\ntitle={Identifying the Risks of {LM} Agents with an {LM}-Emulated Sandbox},\nauthor={Yangjun Ruan and Honghua Dong and Andrew Wang and Silviu Pitis and Yongchao Zhou and Jimmy Ba and Yann Dubois and Chris J.

Our model, Coeditor, is a fine-tuned language model specifically designed for code editing tasks. We represent code changes using a line diff format and employ static analysis to form large customized model contexts, ensuring the availability of appropriate information for prediction. We collect a code editing dataset from the commit histories of 1650 open-source Python projects for training and evaluation. In a simplified single-round, single-edit task, Coeditor significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 and SOTA open-source code completion models (bringing exact-match accuracy from 34.7 up to 60.4), demonstrating the benefits of incorporating editing history for code completion. In a multi-round, multi-edit setting, we observe substantial gains by iteratively conditioning on additional user edits.

To bridge this gap, we propose \\emph{MetaMath}, a finetuned language model that specializes in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we start by bootstrapping mathematical questions by rewriting the question from multiple perspectives, which results in a new dataset called MetaMathQA. Then we finetune the LLaMA-2 models on MetaMathQA. Experimental results on two popular benchmarks (\\ie, GSM8K and MATH) for mathematical reasoning demonstrate that MetaMath outperforms a suite of open-source LLMs by a significant margin.

To improve feedback efficiency, most existing PbRL methods focus on selecting queries to maximally improve the overall quality of the reward model, but counter-intuitively, we find that this may not necessarily lead to improved performance. To unravel this mystery, we identify a long-neglected issue in the query selection schemes of existing PbRL studies: Query-Policy Misalignment. We show that the seemingly informative queries selected to improve the overall quality of reward model actually may not align with RL agents\u2019 interests, thus offering little help on policy learning and eventually resulting in poor feedback efficiency. We show that this issue can be effectively addressed via policy-aligned query and a specially designed hybrid experience replay, which together enforce the bidirectional query-policy alignment. Simple yet elegant, our method can be easily incorporated into existing approaches by changing only a few lines of code. We showcase in comprehensive experiments that our method achieves substantial gains in both human feedback and RL sample efficiency, demonstrating the importance of addressing query-policy misalignment in PbRL tasks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/7731e84686a5dad0613dd42e1b05f91259ca9066.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/7194a1b5194ff6cd1a1ddac5574db5f02f457eac.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nhu2024querypolicy,\ntitle={Query-Policy Misalignment in Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Xiao Hu and Jianxiong Li and Xianyuan Zhan and Qing-Shan Jia and Ya-Qin Zhang},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=UoBymIwPJR}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "hu|querypolicy_misalignment_in_preferencebased_reinforcement_learning"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4518/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4518/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4518/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410908789, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 16, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "reinforcement learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "TS8HoIWAPQ", "forum": "TS8HoIWAPQ", "number": 4508, "cdate": 1695351022078, "tcdate": 1695351022078, "mdate": 1709661511034, "tmdate": 1709661511034, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4508/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4508/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Feature-aligned N-BEATS with Sinkhorn divergence"}, "authors": {"value": ["Joonhun Lee", "Myeongho Jeon", "Myungjoo Kang", "Kyunghyun Park"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Joonhun_Lee1", "~Myeongho_Jeon1", "~Myungjoo_Kang1", "~Kyunghyun_Park1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Time series forecasting", "Deep learning", "Domain generalization", "Representation learning", "Sinkhorn divergence"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We propose Feature-aligned N-BEATS with Sinkhorn divergence, a domain generalization model for time series forecasting within representation learning."}, "abstract": {"value": "We propose Feature-aligned N-BEATS as a domain-generalized time series forecasting model.

This paper presents Instructive Decoding (ID), a simple yet effective approach that augments the efficacy of instruction-tuned models. Specifically, ID adjusts the logits for next-token prediction in a contrastive manner, utilizing predictions generated from a manipulated version of the original instruction, referred to as a noisy instruction. This noisy instruction aims to elicit responses that could diverge from the intended instruction yet remain plausible. We conduct experiments across a spectrum of such noisy instructions, ranging from those that insert semantic noise via random words to others like 'opposite' that elicit the deviated responses. Our approach achieves considerable performance gains across various instruction-tuned models and tasks without necessitating any additional parameter updates.

The recent trend of weakly supervised learning has focused on how to learn an accurate classifier from completely unlabeled data, given little supervised information such as class priors. In this paper, we consider a newly proposed weakly supervised learning problem called multi-class classification from multiple unlabeled datasets, where only multiple sets of unlabeled data and their class priors (i.e., the proportions of each class) are provided for training the classifier. To solve this problem, we first propose a classifier-consistent method (CCM) based on a probability transition matrix. However, CCM cannot guarantee risk consistency and lacks of purified supervision information during training.

Meanwhile, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable efficiency and fault tolerance. By synergistically harnessing the energy efficiency inherent in event cameras and the spike-based processing capabilities of SNNs, their integration could enable ultra-low-power application scenarios, such as action recognition tasks. However, existing approaches often entail converting asynchronous events into conventional frames, leading to additional data mapping efforts and a loss of sparsity, contradicting the design concept of SNNs and event cameras. To address this challenge, we propose SpikePoint, a novel end-to-end point-based SNN architecture. SpikePoint excels at processing sparse event cloud data, effectively extracting both global and local features through a singular-stage structure. Leveraging the surrogate training method, SpikePoint achieves high accuracy with few parameters and maintains low power consumption, specifically employing the identity mapping feature extractor on diverse datasets. SpikePoint achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four event-based action recognition datasets using only 16 timesteps, surpassing other SNN methods. Moreover, it also achieves SOTA performance across all methods on three datasets, utilizing approximately 0.3 % of the parameters and 0.5 % of power consumption employed by artificial neural networks (ANNs).

This extends the previously identified curse of memory in linear RNNs into the general nonlinear setting, and quantifies the essential limitations of the RNN architecture for learning sequential relationships with long-term memory.

While it is common to use importance sampling for OPE, it suffers from high variance when the behavior policy deviates significantly from the target policy. In order to address this issue, some recent works on OPE proposed in-sample learning with importance resampling. Yet, these approaches are not applicable to deterministic target policies for continuous action spaces. To address this limitation, we propose to relax the deterministic target policy using a kernel and learn the kernel metrics that minimize the overall mean squared error of the estimated temporal difference update vector of an action value function, where the action value function is used for policy evaluation. We derive the bias and variance of the estimation error due to this relaxation and provide analytic solutions for the optimal kernel metric. In empirical studies using various test domains, we show that the OPE with in-sample learning using the kernel with optimized metric achieves significantly improved accuracy than other baselines."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/24aac816499705b0d6a509f4908ba2e27ed10775.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/c655aab894dfe05a7f6306b1d7bdf7dc8e705a90.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nlee2024kernel,\ntitle={Kernel Metric Learning for In-Sample Off-Policy Evaluation of Deterministic {RL} Policies},\nauthor={Haanvid Lee and Tri Wahyu Guntara and Jongmin Lee and Yung-Kyun Noh and Kee-Eung Kim},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=plebgsdiiV}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "lee|kernel_metric_learning_for_insample_offpolicy_evaluation_of_deterministic_rl_policies"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4400/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4400/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4400/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410905261, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 12, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "reinforcement learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "ceATjGPTUD", "forum": "ceATjGPTUD", "number": 4397, "cdate": 1695347140535, "tcdate": 1695347140535, "mdate": 1715028375989, "tmdate": 1715028375989, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4397/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4397/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Large Language Models are Efficient Learners of Noise-Robust Speech Recognition"}, "authors": {"value": ["Yuchen Hu", "CHEN CHEN", "Chao-Han Huck Yang", "Ruizhe Li", "Chao Zhang", "Pin-Yu Chen", "EngSiong Chng"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Yuchen_Hu1", "~CHEN_CHEN37", "~Chao-Han_Huck_Yang1", "~Ruizhe_Li2", "~Chao_Zhang20", "~Pin-Yu_Chen1", "~EngSiong_Chng1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Large language models", "automatic speech recognition", "generative error correction", "noise-robustness"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have promoted generative error correction (GER) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), which leverages the rich linguistic knowledge and powerful reasoning ability of LLMs to improve recognition results. The latest work proposes a GER benchmark with \"HyPoradise\" dataset to learn the mapping from ASR N-best hypotheses to ground-truth transcription by efficient LLM finetuning, which shows great effectiveness but lacks specificity on noise-robust ASR. In this work, we extend the benchmark to noisy conditions and investigate if we can teach LLMs to perform denoising for GER just like what robust ASR do, where one solution is introducing noise information as a conditioner into LLM. However, directly incorporating noise embeddings from audio encoder could harm the LLM tuning due to cross-modality gap. To this end, we propose to extract a language-space noise embedding from the N-best list to represent the noise conditions of source speech, which can promote the denoising process in GER. Furthermore, in order to enhance its representation ability of audio noise, we design a knowledge distillation (KD) approach via mutual information estimation to distill the real noise information in audio embeddings to our language embedding. Experiments on various latest LLMs demonstrate our approach achieves a new breakthrough with up to 53.9% correction improvement in terms of word error rate while with limited training data.

Although QD has demonstrated competitive performance in reinforcement learning, its low sample efficiency remains a significant impediment for real-world applications. Recent research has primarily focused on augmenting sample efficiency by refining selection and variation operators of QD. However, one of the less considered yet crucial factors is the inherently large-scale issue of the QD optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Cooperative Coevolution QD (CCQD) framework, which decomposes a policy network naturally into two types of layers, corresponding to representation and decision respectively, and thus simplifies the problem significantly. The resulting two (representation and decision) subpopulations are coevolved cooperatively. CCQD can be implemented with different selection and variation operators. Experiments on several popular tasks within the QDAX suite demonstrate that an instantiation of CCQD achieves approximately a 200% improvement in sample efficiency."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/fcc91cb60f0dd347bc02c8beadb05d7d55b9f04f.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/be2354a20b73f8ab6d22dc510412e7d26ab888ae.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nxue2024sampleefficient,\ntitle={Sample-Efficient Quality-Diversity by Cooperative Coevolution},\nauthor={Ke Xue and Ren-Jian Wang and Pengyi Li and Dong Li and Jianye HAO and Chao Qian},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=JDud6zbpFv}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "xue|sampleefficient_qualitydiversity_by_cooperative_coevolution"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4340/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4340/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4340/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410903459, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 12, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "reinforcement learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "ruk0nyQPec", "forum": "ruk0nyQPec", "number": 4283, "cdate": 1695342764182, "tcdate": 1695342764182, "mdate": 1710468173754, "tmdate": 1710468173754, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4283/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4283/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "SILO Language Models: Isolating Legal Risk In a Nonparametric Datastore"}, "authors": {"value": ["Sewon Min", "Suchin Gururangan", "Eric Wallace", "Weijia Shi", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi", "Noah A.

However, as we show, model performance significantly degrades if trained only on low-risk text (e.g., out-of-copyright books or government documents), due to its limited size and domain coverage. We present SILO, a new language model that manages this risk-performance tradeoff during inference. SILO is built by (1) training a parametric LM on the Open License Corpus (OLC), a new corpus we curate with 228B tokens of public domain and permissively licensed text and (2) augmenting it with a more general and easily modifiable nonparametric datastore (e.g., containing copyrighted books or news) that is only queried during inference. The datastore allows use of high-risk data without training on it, supports sentence-level data attribution, and enables data producers to opt out from the model by removing content from the store. These capabilities can foster compliance with data-use regulations such as the fair use doctrine in the United States and the GDPR in the European Union. Our experiments show that the parametric LM struggles on its own with domains not covered by OLC. However, access to the datastore greatly improves out of domain performance, closing 90% of the performance gap with an LM trained on the Pile, a more diverse corpus with mostly high-risk text. We also analyze which nonparametric approach works best, where the remaining errors lie, and how performance scales with datastore size.

However, these algorithms use a fixed, manually-specified scheme to weight each iteration, which enormously limits their potential. In this work, we propose Dynamic Discounted CFR (DDCFR), the first equilibrium-finding framework that discounts prior iterations using a dynamic, automatically-learned scheme. We formalize CFR\u2019s iteration process as a carefully designed Markov decision process and transform the discounting scheme learning problem into a policy optimization problem within it. The learned discounting scheme dynamically weights each iteration on the fly using information available at runtime.

Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting insights from data. However, existing models typically specialize in either numeric or symbolic domains, and are usually trained in a supervised manner tailored to specific tasks. This approach neglects the substantial benefits that could arise from a task-agnostic multi-modal understanding between symbolic equations and their numeric counterparts. To bridge the gap, we introduce SNIP, a Symbolic-Numeric Integrated Pre-training model, which employs contrastive learning between symbolic and numeric domains, enhancing their mutual similarities in the embeddings. By performing latent space analysis, we observe that SNIP provides cross-domain insights into the representations, revealing that symbolic supervision enhances the embeddings of numeric data and vice versa. We evaluate SNIP across diverse tasks, including symbolic-to-numeric mathematical property prediction and numeric-to-symbolic equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression. Results show that SNIP effectively transfers to various tasks, consistently outperforming fully supervised baselines and competing strongly with established task-specific methods, especially in the low data regime scenarios where available data is limited."}, "primary_area": {"value": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/1ba8f83f76d43ebf7625a6e87d0060d6361310f6.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/5a6cdb08217fa21d5a0fe9b9e8490721c4f5b222.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nmeidani2024snip,\ntitle={{SNIP}: Bridging Mathematical Symbolic and Numeric Realms with Unified Pre-training},\nauthor={Kazem Meidani and Parshin Shojaee and Chandan K.

Given any arbitrary pairing of pretrained models and no external rankings (such as separate test sets, e.g. due to data privacy), we investigate if it is possible to transfer such \"complementary\" knowledge from one model to another without performance degradation \u2013 a task made particularly difficult as additional knowledge can be contained in stronger, equiperformant or weaker models. Yet facilitating robust transfer in scenarios agnostic to pretrained model pairings would unlock auxiliary gains and knowledge fusion from any model repository without restrictions on model and problem specifics - including from weaker, lower-performance models. This work therefore provides an initial, in-depth exploration on the viability of such general-purpose knowledge transfer. Across large-scale experiments, we first reveal the shortcomings of standard knowledge distillation techniques, and then propose a much more general extension through data partitioning for successful transfer between nearly all pretrained models, which we show can also be done unsupervised.

An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable ``perturb-then-diagonalize'' (PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models.

Our proposed algorithm consists of two main steps: (1) estimate the implicit reward using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with general function approximation from offline data and (2) solve a distributionally robust planning problem over a confidence set around the MLE. We consider the general reward setting where the reward can be defined over the whole trajectory and provide a novel guarantee that allows us to learn any target policy with a polynomial number of samples, as long as the target policy is covered by the offline data. This guarantee is the first of its kind with general function approximation. To measure the coverage of the target policy, we introduce a new single-policy concentrability coefficient, which can be upper bounded by the per-trajectory concentrability coefficient. We also establish lower bounds that highlight the necessity of such concentrability and the difference from standard RL, where state-action-wise rewards are directly observed. We further extend and analyze our algorithm when the feedback is given over action pairs."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/ef2a33a9b6e9fd7ea7de7dbba6688f49e0e58206.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/ed858e7f09bcfb8d3cfa3940703ececfd38216c6.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nzhan2024provable,\ntitle={Provable Offline Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Wenhao Zhan and Masatoshi Uehara and Nathan Kallus and Jason D.

While PbRL has demonstrated practical success in fine-tuning language models, existing theoretical work focuses on regret minimization and fails to capture most of the practical frameworks. In this study, we fill in such a gap between theoretical PbRL and practical algorithms by proposing a theoretical reward-agnostic PbRL framework where exploratory trajectories that enable accurate learning of hidden reward functions are acquired before collecting any human feedback. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm requires less human feedback for learning the optimal policy under preference-based models with linear parameterization and unknown transitions, compared to the existing theoretical literature. Specifically, our framework can incorporate linear and low-rank MDPs with efficient sample complexity. Additionally, we investigate reward-agnostic RL with action-based comparison feedback and introduce an efficient querying algorithm tailored to this scenario."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "TLDR": {"value": "PAC reward-agnostic reinforcement learning from preference feedback over trajectories with function approximation."}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/cc1b1fb83857ac10b10a13b0a2c7d061594bfdd8.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/b4bea637d4e093fc1b765a2d6b4524c442a9789f.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nzhan2024provable,\ntitle={Provable Reward-Agnostic Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Wenhao Zhan and Masatoshi Uehara and Wen Sun and Jason D.

This approach enables the capture of long-term dependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms in conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in graph representation learning. \nWe offer an interpretation of the node feature updating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the feature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process.\nWe demonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting.\nExperimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional adaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating their consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's potential as an effective extension to enhance

fundamental challenge in physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is the design of robust PIML methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting tasks. These OOD tasks require learning-to-learn from observations of the same (ODE) dynamical system with different unknown ODE parameters, and demand accurate forecasts even under out-of-support initial conditions and out-of-support ODE parameters. In this work we propose to improve the OOD robustness of PIML via a meta-learning procedure for causal structure discovery. Using three different OOD tasks, we empirically observe that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art PIML and deep learning methods (with $2\\times$ to $28\\times$ lower OOD errors)."}, "primary_area": {"value": "neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/e8efd660b312112ef0fd22c7e460d8a72eb51253.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nmouli2024metaphysica,\ntitle={MetaPhysiCa: Improving {OOD} Robustness in Physics-informed Machine Learning},\nauthor={S Chandra Mouli and Muhammad Alam and Bruno Ribeiro},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=KrWuDiW4Qm}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "mouli|metaphysica_improving_ood_robustness_in_physicsinformed_machine_learning"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4081/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4081/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4081/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410895077, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 20, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "mutJBk3ILg", "forum": "mutJBk3ILg", "number": 4048, "cdate": 1695330782128, "tcdate": 1695330782128, "mdate": 1713499080656, "tmdate": 1713499080656, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4048/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4048/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Views Can Be Deceiving: Improved SSL Through Feature Space Augmentation"}, "authors": {"value": ["Kimia Hamidieh", "Haoran Zhang", "Swami Sankaranarayanan", "Marzyeh Ghassemi"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Kimia_Hamidieh1", "~Haoran_Zhang4", "~Swami_Sankaranarayanan1", "~Marzyeh_Ghassemi2"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Representation Learning", "Spurious Correlations", "Self-supervised Learning"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We study spurious features in self-supervised learning, find augmentations introduce undesired invariances, and propose late-layer regularization for better downstream performance."}, "abstract": {"value": "Supervised learning methods have been found to exhibit inductive biases favoring simpler features.

In this work, we explore the impact of spurious features on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for visual representation learning. We first empirically show that commonly used augmentations in SSL can cause undesired invariances in the image space, and illustrate this with a simple example. We further show that classical approaches in combating spurious correlations, such as dataset re-sampling during SSL, do not consistently lead to invariant representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose LateTVG to remove spurious information from these representations during pre-training, by regularizing later layers of the encoder via pruning.

In some situations, target data labels may be expensive to obtain, so we may only have access to a limited number of target data points. To make the most of a very small target dataset, we propose a lightweight, sample-efficient approach that learns a diverse set of features and adapts to a target distribution by interpolating these features. Our approach, Project and Probe (Pro$^2$), first learns a linear projection that maps a pre-trained embedding onto orthogonal directions while being predictive of labels in the source dataset. The goal of this step is to learn a variety of predictive features, so that at least some of them remain useful after distribution shift. Pro$^2$ then learns a linear classifier on top of these projected features using a small target dataset. Theoretically, we find that Pro$^2$ results in more sample-efficient generalization by inducing a favorable bias-variance tradeoff. Our experiments on four datasets, with multiple distribution shift settings for each, show that Pro$^2$ improves performance by 5-15% when given limited target data compared to prior methods such as standard linear probing."}, "primary_area": {"value": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/c7ebd7fa822b912a9fa27ca0702572a707ec85e6.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nchen2024project,\ntitle={Project and Probe: Sample-Efficient Adaptation by Interpolating Orthogonal Features},\nauthor={Annie S Chen and Yoonho Lee and Amrith Setlur and Sergey Levine and Chelsea Finn},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=f6CBQYxXvr}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "chen|project_and_probe_sampleefficient_adaptation_by_interpolating_orthogonal_features"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3993/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3993/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3993/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410891929, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 17, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "P1aobHnjjj", "forum": "P1aobHnjjj", "number": 3990, "cdate": 1695329396710, "tcdate": 1695329396710, "mdate": 1710453432042, "tmdate": 1710453432042, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3990/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3990/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Implicit bias of SGD in $L_2$-regularized linear DNNs: One-way jumps from high to low rank"}, "authors": {"value": ["Zihan Wang", "Arthur Jacot"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Zihan_Wang20", "~Arthur_Jacot1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["implicit bias", "SGD", "low-rank", "linear networks"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "Low-rank bias of SGD in L2 reg. linear nets: SGD jumps from high to low rank minima, with no probability of jumping back."}, "abstract": {"value": "The $L_{2}$-regularized loss of Deep Linear Networks (DLNs) with\nmore than one hidden layers has multiple local minima, corresponding\nto matrices with different ranks.

However, we are yet to see high-quality, well-structured **whole-song** generation. In this paper, we make the first attempt to model a full music piece under the realization of *compositional hierarchy*. With a focus on symbolic representations of pop songs, we define a hierarchical language, in which each level of hierarchy focuses on the semantics and context dependency at a certain music scope. The high-level languages reveal whole-song form, phrase, and cadence, whereas the low-level languages focus on notes, chords, and their local patterns. A cascaded diffusion model is trained to model the hierarchical language, where each level is conditioned on its upper levels.

This technique has shown particular strength in improving the performance of modestly sized LLMs, sometimes inducing performance competitive with much larger model variants. In this paper, we ask two questions: (1) How sensitive are instruction-tuned models to the particular phrasings of instructions, and, (2) How can we make them more robust to such natural language variation? To answer the former, we collect a set of 319 instructions manually written by NLP practitioners for over 80 unique tasks included in widely used benchmarks, and we evaluate the variance and average performance of these instructions as compared to instruction phrasings observed during instruction fine-tuning. We find that using novel (unobserved) but appropriate instruction phrasings consistently degrades model performance, sometimes substantially so. Further, such natural instructions yield a wide variance in downstream performance, despite their semantic equivalence. Put another way, instruction-tuned models are not especially robust to instruction re-phrasings. \nWe propose a simple method to mitigate this issue by introducing ``soft prompt'' embedding parameters and optimizing these to maximize the similarity between representations of semantically equivalent instructions.

This suggests that critical periods may be fundamental to learning and not an accident of biology.\nYet, why exactly critical periods emerge in deep networks is still an open question, and in particular it is unclear whether the critical periods observed in both systems depend on particular architectural or optimization details. To isolate the key underlying factors, we focus on deep linear network models, and show that, surprisingly, such networks also display much of the behavior seen in biology and artificial networks, while being amenable to analytical treatment. We show that critical periods depend on the depth of the model and structure of the data distribution. We also show analytically and in simulations that the learning of features is tied to competition between sources. Finally, we extend our analysis to multi-task learning to show that pre-training on certain tasks can damage the transfer performance on new tasks, and show how this depends on the relationship between tasks and the duration of the pre-training stage.

policy, which demonstrates task-level generalization in both simulation and the real world."}, "abstract": {"value": "Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scene-level diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models' (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GenSim, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM  bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%.

function given by the augmentation, we disentangle the effects of the model and the augmentation,\nand prove two generalization bounds that are free of model complexity.\nOur first bound works for an arbitrary encoder, and it is the sum of an estimation error bound incurred by fitting a linear probe, and an approximation error bound by RKHS approximation.\nOur second bound specifically addresses

We present a case study of syntax acquisition in masked language models (MLMs) that demonstrates how analyzing the evolution of interpretable artifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of emergent behavior. In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS), a naturally emerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend to focus on specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in pretraining when models abruptly acquire SAS, concurrent with a steep drop in loss. This breakthrough precipitates the subsequent acquisition of linguistic capabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS by manipulating SAS during training, and demonstrate that SAS is necessary for the development of grammatical capabilities. We further find that SAS competes with other beneficial traits during training, and that briefly suppressing SAS improves model quality.

Nevertheless, concerns surrounding data privacy present obstacles due to the tuned prompts' dependency on sensitive private information. A practical solution is to host a local LLM and optimize a soft prompt privately using data. Yet, hosting a local model becomes problematic when model ownership is protected. Alternative methods, like sending data to the model's provider for training, intensify these privacy issues facing an untrusted provider. In this paper, we present a novel solution called Differentially-Private Offsite Prompt Tuning (DP-OPT) to address this challenge. Our approach involves tuning a discrete prompt on the client side and then applying it to the desired cloud models. We demonstrate that prompts suggested by LLMs themselves can be transferred without compromising performance significantly. To ensure that the prompts do not leak private information, we introduce the first private prompt generation mechanism, by a differentially-private (DP) ensemble of in-context learning with private demonstrations.  With DP-OPT, generating privacy-preserving prompts by Vicuna-7b can yield competitive performance compared to non-private in-context learning on GPT3.5 or local private prompt tuning.\nCodes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/DP-OPT."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/6dfeb74c7c420594a6132f6bfe094a53dbf73317.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nhong2024dpopt,\ntitle={{DP}-{OPT}: Make Large Language Model Your Privacy-Preserving Prompt Engineer},\nauthor={Junyuan Hong and Jiachen T.

Recent work embeds coordinates using sine and cosine projections based on Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) features. These embeddings assume a rectangular data domain even on global data, which can lead to artifacts, especially at the poles. At the same time, little attention has been paid to the exact design of the neural network architectures with which these functional embeddings are combined. This work proposes a novel location encoder for globally distributed geographic data that combines spherical harmonic basis functions, natively defined on spherical surfaces, with sinusoidal representation networks (SirenNets) that can be interpreted as learned Double Fourier Sphere embedding. We systematically evaluate positional embeddings and neural network architectures across various benchmarks and synthetic evaluation datasets. In contrast to previous approaches that require the combination of both positional encoding and neural networks to learn meaningful representations, we show that both spherical harmonics and sinusoidal representation networks are competitive on their own but set state-of-the-art performances across tasks when combined.

To allow domain experts to customize the optimization routine, we propose ColaBO, the first Bayesian-principled framework for incorporating prior beliefs beyond the typical kernel structure, such as the likely location of the optimizer or the optimal value. The generality of ColaBO makes it applicable across different Monte Carlo acquisition functions and types of user beliefs.

been a significant surge in multimodal learning in terms of both image-to-text and text-to-image generation.

Building a competitive counterpart in other languages is highly challenging due to the low-resource nature of non-English multimodal data (i.e., lack of large-scale, high-quality image-text data). In this work, we propose MPM, an effective training paradigm for training large multimodal models in low-resource languages. MPM demonstrates that Multilingual language models can Pivot zero-shot Multimodal learning across languages. Specifically, based on a strong multilingual large language model, multimodal models pretrained on English-only image-text data can well generalize to other languages in a (quasi)-zero-shot manner, even surpassing models trained on image-text data in native languages. Taking Chinese as a practice of MPM, we build large multimodal models VisCPM in image-to-text and text-to-image generation, which achieve state-of-the-art (open-source) performance in Chinese.

different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert.\nAs in other MoEs, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity (and performance) at lower inference cost.\nIn the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms dense Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoEs (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice).\nSoft MoE

various supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms, which can effectively utilize the colossal amount of data to train models. However, before deploying these models in the real world, these must be strictly evaluated on performance measures like worst-case recall and satisfy constraints such as fairness. We find that current state-of-the-art empirical techniques offer sub-optimal performance on these practical, non-decomposable performance objectives. On the other hand, the theoretical techniques necessitate training a new model from scratch for each performance objective. To bridge the gap, we propose SelMix, a selective mixup-based inexpensive fine-tuning technique for pre-trained models, to optimize for the desired objective. The core idea of our framework is to determine a sampling distribution to perform a mixup of features between samples from particular classes such that it optimizes the given objective.  We comprehensively evaluate our technique against the existing empirical and theoretically principled methods on standard benchmark datasets for imbalanced classification. We find that proposed SelMix fine-tuning significantly improves the performance for various practical non-decomposable objectives across benchmarks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "general machine learning (i.e., none of the above)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/42154f6a78eb07727368d3e4f20969606728ec4b.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nramasubramanian2024selective,\ntitle={Selective Mixup Fine-Tuning for Optimizing Non-Decomposable Objectives},\nauthor={Shrinivas Ramasubramanian and Harsh Rangwani and Sho Takemori and Kunal Samanta and Yuhei Umeda and Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rxVBKhyfSo}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "ramasubramanian|selective_mixup_finetuning_for_optimizing_nondecomposable_objectives"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3669/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3669/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3669/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410881736, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 15, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "general machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "6O3Q6AFUTu", "forum": "6O3Q6AFUTu", "number": 3634, "cdate": 1695308867406, "tcdate": 1695308867406, "mdate": 1713673004251, "tmdate": 1713673004251, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3634/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "NoiseDiffusion: Correcting Noise for Image  Interpolation  with Diffusion Models beyond Spherical Linear Interpolation"}, "authors": {"value": ["PengFei Zheng", "Yonggang Zhang", "Zhen Fang", "Tongliang Liu", "Defu Lian", "Bo Han"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~PengFei_Zheng2", "~Yonggang_Zhang1", "~Zhen_Fang2", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "~Defu_Lian1", "~Bo_Han1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Image Interpolation;

Specifically, NoiseDiffusion approaches the invalid noise to the expected distribution by introducing subtle Gaussian noise and introduces a constraint to suppress noise with extreme values. In this context, promoting noise validity contributes to mitigating image artifacts, but the constraint and introduced exogenous noise typically lead to a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., loss of original image information. Hence, NoiseDiffusion performs interpolation within the noisy image space and injects raw images into these noisy counterparts to address the challenge of information loss. Consequently, NoiseDiffusion enables us to interpolate natural images without causing artifacts or information loss, thus achieving the best interpolation results."}, "primary_area": {"value": "generative models"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/9bcefae56342d9cecd1e962c0a0c0cab8b325854.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nzheng2024noisediffusion,\ntitle={NoiseDiffusion: Correcting Noise for Image  Interpolation  with Diffusion Models beyond Spherical Linear Interpolation},\nauthor={PengFei Zheng and Yonggang Zhang and Zhen Fang and Tongliang Liu and Defu Lian and Bo Han},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=6O3Q6AFUTu}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "zheng|noisediffusion_correcting_noise_for_image_interpolation_with_diffusion_models_beyond_spherical_linear_interpolation"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3634/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3634/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3634/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410880370, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 17, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "generative models", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "di52zR8xgf", "forum": "di52zR8xgf", "number": 3626, "cdate": 1695308680954, "tcdate": 1695308680954, "mdate": 1713255392319, "tmdate": 1713255392319, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3626/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3626/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "SDXL: Improving Latent Diffusion Models for High-Resolution Image Synthesis"}, "authors": {"value": ["Dustin Podell", "Zion English", "Kyle Lacey", "Andreas Blattmann", "Tim Dockhorn", "Jonas M\u00fcller", "Joe Penna", "Robin Rombach"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Dustin_Podell1", "~Zion_English1", "~Kyle_Lacey1", "~Andreas_Blattmann1", "~Tim_Dockhorn1", "~Jonas_M\u00fcller1", "~Joe_Penna1", "~Robin_Rombach1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Image Synthesis", "Diffusion", "Generative AI"]}, "abstract": {"value": "We present Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), a latent diffusion model for text-to-image synthesis.

In principle, Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a general approach to learn object manipulation. In practice, however, domains with more than a few objects are difficult for RL agents due to the curse of dimensionality, especially when learning from raw image observations. In this work we propose a structured approach for visual RL that is suitable for representing multiple objects and their interaction, and use it to learn goal-conditioned manipulation of several objects. Key to our method is the ability to handle goals with dependencies between the objects (e.g., moving objects in a certain order). We further relate our architecture to the generalization capability of the trained agent, based on a theoretical result for compositional generalization, and demonstrate agents that learn with 3 objects but generalize to similar tasks with over 10 objects.

Such problems have recently gained significant attention due to their broad applicability in machine learning. However, conventional gradient-based methods unavoidably rely on computationally intensive calculations related to the Hessian matrix. To address this challenge, we devise a smooth proximal Lagrangian value function to handle the constrained lower-level problem. Utilizing this construct, we introduce a single-level reformulation for constrained BLOs that transforms the original BLO problem into an equivalent optimization problem with smooth constraints. Enabled by this reformulation, we develop a Hessian-free gradient-based algorithm\u2014termed proximal Lagrangian Value function-based Hessian-free Bi-level Algorithm (LV-HBA)\u2014that is straightforward to implement in a single loop manner. Consequently, LV-HBA is especially well-suited for machine learning applications.

Our main technique is showing that the network evolves in two phases: a \\em signal-finding \\em phase where the network is small and many of the neurons evolve independently to find features, and a \\em signal-heavy \\em phase, where SGD maintains and balances the features. We leverage the simultaneous training of the layers to show that it is sufficient for only a small fraction of the neurons to learn features, since those neurons will be amplified by the simultaneous growth of their second layer weights."}, "primary_area": {"value": "learning theory"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/d00625c7d5210386b43eec8c623aa8b9a3158712.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/8b1780346b88534d9bfd63f65b47944e2581da7b.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nglasgow2024sgd,\ntitle={{SGD} Finds then Tunes Features in Two-Layer Neural Networks with near-Optimal Sample Complexity: A Case Study in the {XOR} problem},\nauthor={Margalit Glasgow},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HgOJlxzB16}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "glasgow|sgd_finds_then_tunes_features_in_twolayer_neural_networks_with_nearoptimal_sample_complexity_a_case_study_in_the_xor_problem"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3450/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3450/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3450/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410875505, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 14, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "learning theory", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "gjfOL9z5Xr", "forum": "gjfOL9z5Xr", "number": 3441, "cdate": 1695296729391, "tcdate": 1695296729391, "mdate": 1713672374540, "tmdate": 1713672374540, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3441/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3441/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "DyVal: Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Reasoning Tasks"}, "authors": {"value": ["Kaijie Zhu", "Jiaao Chen", "Jindong Wang", "Neil Zhenqiang Gong", "Diyi Yang", "Xing Xie"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Kaijie_Zhu1", "~Jiaao_Chen2", "~Jindong_Wang1", "~Neil_Zhenqiang_Gong1", "~Diyi_Yang2", "~Xing_Xie3"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Large Language Models", "Evaluation", "Data Contamination"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various evaluation benchmarks.

DyVal generates challenging evaluation sets on reasoning tasks including mathematics, logical reasoning, and algorithm problems. We evaluate various LLMs ranging from Flan-T5-large to GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4.

Signal delay occurs when there is a lag between an agent's perception of the environment and its corresponding actions. In this paper, we first formalize delayed-observation Markov decision processes (DOMDP) by extending the standard MDP framework to incorporate signal delays. Next, we elucidate the challenges posed by the presence of signal delay in DRL, showing that trivial DRL algorithms and generic methods for partially observable tasks suffer greatly from delays. Lastly, we propose effective strategies to overcome these challenges. Our methods achieve remarkable performance in continuous robotic control tasks with large delays, yielding results comparable to those in non-delayed cases.

In addition, the generated images should have arbitrary image aspect ratios. When generating images directly at a higher resolution, 1024 x 1024, with the pre-trained Stable Diffusion using training images of resolution 512 x 512, we observe persistent problems of object repetition and unreasonable object structures. Existing works for higher-resolution generation, such as attention-based and joint-diffusion approaches, cannot well address these issues. As a new perspective, we examine the structural components of the U-Net in diffusion models and identify the crucial cause as the limited perception field of convolutional kernels. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective re-dilation that can dynamically adjust the convolutional perception field during inference. We further propose the dispersed convolution and noise-damped classifier-free guidance, which can enable ultra-high-resolution image generation  (e.g., 4096 x 4096). Notably, our approach does not require any training or optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can address the repetition issue well and achieve state-of-the-art performance on higher-resolution image synthesis, especially in texture details. Our work also suggests that a pre-trained diffusion model trained on low-resolution images can be directly used for high-resolution visual generation without further tuning, which may provide insights for future research on ultra-high-resolution image and video synthesis.

tasks.\nDespite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the

their ability to explore effectively. \nExpanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents' inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks.\nTo quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent's network.\nEmpirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent's activity level, regardless of the received reward signals.\nLeveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce DrM, a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents' exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. \nExperiments demonstrate that  DrM achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit.\nMost importantly, DrM is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the

descent (GD) for the matrix sensing problem, where the goal is to recover an unknown low-rank ground-truth matrix from near-isotropic linear measurements.\nFirst, we consider the symmetric setting with the symmetric parameterization where $M^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a positive semi-definite unknown matrix of rank $r \\ll n$, and one uses a symmetric parameterization $XX^\\top$ to learn $M^*$. Here $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$ with $k > r$ is the factor matrix. We give a novel $\\Omega\\left(1/T^2\\right)$ lower bound of randomly initialized GD for the over-parameterized case ($k >r$) where $T$ is the number of iterations. This is in stark contrast to the exact-parameterization scenario ($k=r$) where the convergence rate is $\\exp\\left(-\\Omega\\left(T\\right)\\right)$. Next, we study asymmetric setting where $M^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \\times n_2}$ is the unknown matrix of rank $r \\ll \\min\\{n_1,n_2\\}$, and one uses an asymmetric parameterization $FG^\\top$ to learn $M^*$ where $F \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \\times k}$ and $G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_2 \\times k}$. We give the first global exact convergence result of randomly initialized GD for the exact-parameterization case ($k=r$) with an $\\exp\\left(-\\Omega\\left(T\\right)\\right)$ rate. Furthermore, we give the first global exact convergence result for the over-parameterization case ($k>r$) with an $\\exp\\left(-\\Omega\\left(\\alpha^2 T\\right)\\right)$ rate where $\\alpha$ is the initialization scale. This linear convergence result in the over-parameterization case is especially significant because one can apply the asymmetric parameterization to the symmetric setting to speed up from $\\Omega\\left(1/T^2\\right)$ to linear convergence. Therefore, we identify a surprising phenomenon: asymmetric parameterization can exponentially speed up convergence. Equally surprising is our analysis that highlights the importance of imbalance between $F$ and $G$. This is in sharp contrast to prior works which emphasize balance.  We further give an example showing the dependency on $\\alpha$ in the convergence rate is unavoidable in the worst case. On the other hand, we propose a novel method that only modifies one step of GD and obtains a convergence rate independent of $\\alpha$, recovering the rate in the exact-parameterization case. We provide empirical studies to verify our theoretical findings."}, "primary_area": {"value": "learning theory"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/85f424e5914d2f97c9b19f6dc6f35512876e93ac.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/ff831e16c79733570ec7acf52fea0b4c2539286f.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nxiong2024how,\ntitle={How Over-Parameterization Slows Down Gradient Descent in Matrix Sensing: The Curses of Symmetry and Initialization},\nauthor={Nuoya Xiong and Lijun Ding and Simon Shaolei Du},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=xGvPKAiOhq}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "xiong|how_overparameterization_slows_down_gradient_descent_in_matrix_sensing_the_curses_of_symmetry_and_initialization"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3284/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3284/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3284/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410869721, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 17, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "learning theory", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "ezBH9WE9s2", "forum": "ezBH9WE9s2", "number": 3269, "cdate": 1695283051195, "tcdate": 1695283051195, "mdate": 1709884678376, "tmdate": 1709884678376, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3269/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3269/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "AnyText: Multilingual Visual Text Generation and Editing"}, "authors": {"value": ["Yuxiang Tuo", "Wangmeng Xiang", "Jun-Yan He", "Yifeng Geng", "Xuansong Xie"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Yuxiang_Tuo2", "~Wangmeng_Xiang1", "~Jun-Yan_He2", "~Yifeng_Geng2", "~Xuansong_Xie1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["diffusion model", "text-to-image", "text generation"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Diffusion model based Text-to-Image has achieved impressive achievements recently. Although current technology for synthesizing images is highly advanced and capable of generating images with high fidelity, it is still possible to give the show away when focusing on the text area in the generated image, as synthesized text often contains blurred, unreadable, or incorrect characters, making visual text generation one of the most challenging issues in this field. To address this issue, we introduce AnyText, a diffusion-based multilingual visual text generation and editing model, that focuses on rendering accurate and coherent text in the image. AnyText comprises a diffusion pipeline with two primary elements: an auxiliary latent module and a text embedding module. The former uses inputs like text glyph, position, and masked image to generate latent features for text generation or editing. The latter employs an OCR model for encoding stroke data as embeddings, which blend with image caption embeddings from the tokenizer to generate texts that seamlessly integrate with the background. We employed text-control diffusion loss and text perceptual loss for training to further enhance writing accuracy. AnyText can write characters in multiple languages, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address multilingual visual text generation. It is worth mentioning that AnyText can be plugged into existing diffusion models from the community for rendering or editing text accurately. After conducting extensive evaluation experiments, our method has outperformed all other approaches by a significant margin.

Concretely, we introduce the code data at the pre-training stage, instruction-tuning stage, and both of them, respectively. Then, the reasoning capability of LLMs is comprehensively and fairly evaluated via six reasoning tasks. We critically analyze the experimental results and provide conclusions with insights. First, pre-training LLMs with the mixture of code and text can significantly enhance LLMs' general reasoning capability almost without negative transfer on other tasks. Besides, at the instruction-tuning stage, code data endows LLMs the task-specific reasoning capability. Moreover, the dynamic mixing strategy of code and text data assists LLMs to learn reasoning capability step-by-step during training.

Numerous methodologies have been proposed, and techniques employing MLPs and grid representations have achieved substantial success. MLPs allow compact and high expressibility, yet often suffer from spectral bias and slow convergence speed. On the other hand, methods using grids are free from spectral bias and achieve fast training speed, however, at the expense of high spatial complexity. In this work, we propose a novel way for exploiting both MLPs and grid representations in neural fields. Unlike the prevalent methods that combine them sequentially (extract features from the grids first and feed them to the MLP), we inject spectral bias-free grid representations into the intermediate features in the MLP. More specifically, we suggest a Coordinate-Aware Modulation (CAM), which modulates the intermediate features using scale and shift parameters extracted from the grid representations. This can maintain the strengths of MLPs while mitigating any remaining potential biases, facilitating the rapid learning of high-frequency components. In addition, we empirically found that the feature normalizations, which have not been successful in neural filed literature, proved to be effective when applied in conjunction with the proposed CAM. Experimental results demonstrate that CAM enhances the performance of neural representation and improves learning stability across a range of signals. Especially in the novel view synthesis task, we achieved state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and fast training speed for dynamic scenes and the best performance under 1MB memory for static scenes. CAM also outperforms the best-performing video compression methods using neural fields by a large margin.

A ConvBN block can operate in three modes: Train, Eval, and Deploy. While the Train mode is indispensable for training models from scratch, the Eval mode is suitable for transfer learning and beyond, and the Deploy mode is designed for the deployment of models. This paper focuses on the trade-off between stability and efficiency in ConvBN blocks: Deploy mode is efficient but suffers from training instability; Eval mode is widely used in transfer learning but lacks efficiency. To solve the dilemma, we theoretically reveal the reason behind the diminished training stability observed in the Deploy mode. Subsequently, we propose a novel Tune mode to bridge the gap between Eval mode and Deploy mode. The proposed Tune mode is as stable as Eval mode for transfer learning, and its computational efficiency closely matches that of the Deploy mode. Through extensive experiments in object detection, classification, and adversarial example generation across $5$ datasets and $12$ model architectures, we demonstrate that the proposed Tune mode retains the performance while significantly reducing GPU memory footprint and training time, thereby contributing efficient ConvBN blocks for transfer learning and beyond.

While the technical level deals with the accurate reconstruction of transmitted symbols, the semantic and effectiveness levels deal with the inferred meaning and its effect on the receiver. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their wide generalizability, make some progress towards the second level. However, LLMs and other communication models are not conventionally designed for predicting and optimizing communication for desired receiver behaviors and intents. As a result, the effectiveness level remains largely untouched by modern communication systems. In this paper, we introduce the receivers' \"behavior tokens,\" such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases, and retweets, in the LLM's training corpora to optimize content for the receivers and predict their behaviors. Other than showing similar performance to LLMs on content understanding tasks, our trained models show generalization capabilities on the behavior dimension for behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation. We show results on all these capabilities using a wide range of tasks on three corpora. We call these models Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs). Further, to spur more research on LCBMs, we release our new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC), a repository containing communicator, message, and corresponding receiver behavior (https://behavior-in-the-wild.github.io/LCBM)."}, "primary_area": {"value": "generative models"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/b2522b24d83cf73195d3d49d25c22b11f9633228.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nkhandelwal2024large,\ntitle={Large Content And Behavior Models To Understand, Simulate, And Optimize Content And Behavior},\nauthor={Ashmit Khandelwal and Aditya Agrawal and Aanisha Bhattacharyya and Yaman Kumar and Somesh Singh and Uttaran Bhattacharya and Ishita Dasgupta and Stefano Petrangeli and Rajiv Ratn Shah and Changyou Chen and Balaji Krishnamurthy},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=TrKq4Wlwcz}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "khandelwal|large_content_and_behavior_models_to_understand_simulate_and_optimize_content_and_behavior"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3140/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3140/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410865875, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 18, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "generative models", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "2cRzmWXK9N", "forum": "2cRzmWXK9N", "number": 3139, "cdate": 1695275107836, "tcdate": 1695275107836, "mdate": 1709661496889, "tmdate": 1709661496889, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3139/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3139/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Beyond Reverse KL: Generalizing Direct Preference Optimization with Diverse Divergence Constraints"}, "authors": {"value": ["Chaoqi Wang", "Yibo Jiang", "Chenghao Yang", "Han Liu", "Yuxin Chen"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Chaoqi_Wang1", "~Yibo_Jiang2", "~Chenghao_Yang1", "~Han_Liu12", "~Yuxin_Chen1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Large language models", "Preference optimization", "AI Alignment"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "This paper extends the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to incorporate diverse divergence constraints, offering a more versatile approach to align AI with human values."}, "abstract": {"value": "The increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raise opportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify safety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating effective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges due to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative; and it remains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This paper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including Jensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\\alpha$-divergences, the complex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be simplified by addressing the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions. This eliminates the need for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and enables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy. Our approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient and supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically, adopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and generation diversity. Importantly, our $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in divergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected calibration error (ECE)."}, "primary_area": {"value": "general machine learning (i.e., none of the above)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/161cf92d489db9ea1ae0f43eab7797245e967c2c.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nwang2024beyond,\ntitle={Beyond Reverse {KL}: Generalizing Direct Preference Optimization with Diverse Divergence Constraints},\nauthor={Chaoqi Wang and Yibo Jiang and Chenghao Yang and Han Liu and Yuxin Chen},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=2cRzmWXK9N}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "wang|beyond_reverse_kl_generalizing_direct_preference_optimization_with_diverse_divergence_constraints"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3139/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3139/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3139/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410865832, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 13, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "general machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "CYmF38ysDa", "forum": "CYmF38ysDa", "number": 3099, "cdate": 1695269624633, "tcdate": 1695269624633, "mdate": 1709661496545, "tmdate": 1709661496545, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3099/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3099/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "FLASK: Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets"}, "authors": {"value": ["Seonghyeon Ye", "Doyoung Kim", "Sungdong Kim", "Hyeonbin Hwang", "Seungone Kim", "Yongrae Jo", "James Thorne", "Juho Kim", "Minjoon Seo"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Seonghyeon_Ye1", "~Doyoung_Kim3", "~Sungdong_Kim1", "~Hyeonbin_Hwang1", "~Seungone_Kim1", "~Yongrae_Jo1", "~James_Thorne1", "~Juho_Kim2", "~Minjoon_Seo1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["large language models", "language model evaluation", "natural language processing"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We introduce fine-grained language model evaluation based on alignment skill sets to measure the performance of various LLMs."}, "abstract": {"value": "Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging because instruction-following necessitates alignment with human values and the required set of skills varies depending on the instruction.

In this paper, we introduce FLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets), a fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based evaluation which decomposes coarse-level scoring to a skill set-level scoring for each instruction. We experimentally observe that the fine-graininess of evaluation is crucial for attaining a holistic view of model performance and increasing the reliability of the evaluation.

Nevertheless, their practicality for low-latency real-world applications is constrained by substantial computational costs and latency issues. Quantization is a dominant way to compress and accelerate diffusion models, where post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) are two main approaches, each bearing its own properties. While PTQ exhibits efficiency in terms of both time and data usage, it may lead to diminished performance in low bit-width settings. On the other hand, QAT can help alleviate performance degradation but comes with substantial demands on computational and data resources. To capitalize on the advantages while avoiding their respective drawbacks, we introduce a data-free, quantization-aware and parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for low-bit diffusion models, dubbed EfficientDM, to achieve QAT-level performance with PTQ-like efficiency. Specifically, we propose a quantization-aware variant of the low-rank adapter (QALoRA) that can be merged with model weights and jointly quantized to low bit-width. The fine-tuning process distills the denoising capabilities of the full-precision model into its quantized counterpart, eliminating the requirement for training data. To further enhance performance, we introduce scale-aware optimization to address ineffective learning of QALoRA due to variations in weight quantization scales across different layers. We also employ temporal learned step-size quantization to handle notable variations in activation distributions across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous PTQ-based diffusion models while maintaining similar time and data efficiency. Specifically, there is only a marginal $0.05$ sFID increase when quantizing both weights and activations of LDM-4 to 4-bit on ImageNet $256\\times256$. Compared to QAT-based methods, our EfficientDM also boasts a $16.2\\times$ faster quantization speed with comparable generation quality, rendering it a compelling choice for practical applications."},

Even more intriguingly, this can be achieved by a simple yet previously overlooked strategy -- employing a frozen transformer block from pre-trained LLMs as a constituent encoder layer to directly process visual tokens. Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging LLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional practices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with associated language prompts, inputs, or outputs. We demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks} encompassing pure 2D or 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point cloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition), non-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g., 2D/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval). Such improvements are a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and OPT) and different LLM transformer blocks. We additionally propose the information filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained LLMs in visual encoding -- the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks discern informative visual tokens and further amplify their effect. This hypothesis is empirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after training with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant regions.

However, high-level optimizations such as API and algorithm changes remain elusive due to the difficulty of understanding the semantics of code. Simultaneously, pretrained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities at solving a wide range of programming tasks. To that end, we introduce a framework for adapting LLMs to high-level program optimization. First, we curate a dataset of performance-improving edits made by human programmers of over 77,000 competitive C++ programming submission pairs, accompanied by extensive unit tests. A major challenge is the significant variability of measuring performance on commodity hardware, which can lead to spurious \"improvements.\" To isolate and reliably evaluate the impact of program optimizations, we design an environment based on the gem5 full system simulator, the de facto simulator used in academia and industry. Next, we propose a broad range of adaptation strategies for code optimization; for prompting, these include retrieval-based few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought, and for finetuning, these include performance-conditioned generation and synthetic data augmentation based on self-play. A combination of these techniques achieves a mean speedup of 6.86$\\times$ with eight generations, higher than average optimizations from individual programmers (3.66$\\times$). Using our model's fastest generations, we set a new upper limit on the fastest speedup possible for our dataset at 9.64$\\times$ compared to using the fastest human submissions available (9.56$\\times$)."}, "primary_area": {"value": "datasets and benchmarks"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/e94f139ce25197392e4252dc56ed557ff74094fd.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/2ed5e8d1a32892498040922cd560750929883383.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nshypula2024learning,\ntitle={Learning Performance-Improving Code Edits},\nauthor={Alexander G Shypula and Aman Madaan and Yimeng Zeng and Uri Alon and Jacob R.

However, MC integration is not optimal in terms of absolute approximation error. To provide a better class of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between probability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically evaluate various methods to construct QMC point sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere, including the Gaussian-based and equal area mappings, generalized spiral points, and optimizing discrepancy energies.

In the cascading bandit model, at each timestep, an agent recommends an ordered subset of items (called an item list) from a pool of items, each associated with an unknown attraction probability. Then, the user examines the list, and clicks the first attractive item (if any), and after that, the agent receives a reward. The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected cumulative reward. However, the prior literature on cascading bandits ignores the influences of user states (e.g., historical behaviors) on recommendations and the change of states as the session proceeds. Motivated by this fact, we propose a generalized cascading RL framework, which considers the impact of user states and state transition into decisions. In cascading RL, we need to select items not only with  large attraction probabilities but also leading to good successor states. This imposes a huge computational challenge due to the combinatorial action space. To tackle this challenge, we delve into the properties of value functions, and design an oracle BestPerm to efficiently find the optimal item list. Equipped with BestPerm, we develop two algorithms CascadingVI and CascadingBPI, which are both computationally-efficient and sample-efficient, and provide near-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees. Furthermore, we present experiments to show the improved computational and sample efficiencies of our algorithms compared to straightforward adaptations of existing RL algorithms in practice."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/831efaa7342d514569de4663496b0ff76a04015a.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\ndu2024cascading,\ntitle={Cascading Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Yihan Du and R.

Here we construct a recurrent circuit model that can implicitly represent priors over latent variables, and combine them with sensory and contextual sources of information to encode task-specific posteriors. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models as means of learning and using priors over images, our model uses dendritic nonlinearities optimized for denoising, and stochastic somatic integration with the degree of noise modulated by an oscillating global signal. Combining these elements into a recurrent network yields a stochastic dynamical system that samples from the prior at a rate prescribed by the period of the global oscillator. Additional inputs reflecting sensory or top-down contextual information alter these dynamics to generate samples from the corresponding posterior, with different input gating patterns selecting different inference tasks. We demonstrate that this architecture can sample from low dimensional nonlinear manifolds and multimodal posteriors.

However, a well-known concern about traditional task-specific vision models is that they can be misled by imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the concern is exacerbated by the phenomenon that the same adversarial perturbations can fool different task-specific models. Given that VLMs rely on prompts to adapt to different tasks, an intriguing question emerges: Can a single adversarial image mislead all predictions of VLMs when a thousand different prompts are given? This question essentially introduces a novel perspective on adversarial transferability: cross-prompt adversarial transferability. In this work, we propose the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA).

Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. We propose **One for All (OFA)**, the first general framework that can use a single graph model to address the above challenges. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs."}, "primary_area": {"value": "learning on graphs and other geometries &

registration, completion, editing, and understanding. However, given a set of 3D shapes with associated covariates there is at present no shape representation method which allows to precisely represent the shapes while capturing the individual dependencies on each covariate. Such a method would be of high utility to researchers to discover knowledge hidden in a population of shapes. For scientific shape discovery purpose, we propose a 3D Neural Additive Model for Interpretable Shape Representation ($\\texttt{NAISR}$) which describes individual shapes by deforming a shape atlas in accordance to the effect of disentangled covariates. Our approach captures shape population trends and allows for patient-specific predictions through shape transfer. $\\texttt{NAISR}$ is the first approach to combine the benefits of deep implicit shape representations with an atlas deforming according to specified covariates. We evaluate $\\texttt{NAISR}$ with respect to shape reconstruction, shape disentanglement, shape evolution, and shape transfer on three datasets, i.e. 1) $\\textit{Starman}$, a simulated 2D shape dataset; 2) ADNI hippocampus 3D shape dataset; 3) pediatric airway 3D shape dataset.

Our primary theoretical findings analytically characterize the features learned by stylized neural networks for these algebraic tasks. Notably, our main technique demonstrates how the principle of margin maximization alone can be used to fully specify the features learned by the network. \nSpecifically, we prove that the trained networks utilize Fourier features to perform modular addition and employ features corresponding to irreducible group-theoretic representations to perform compositions in general groups, aligning closely with the empirical observations of Nanda et al.

Such a fact directly implies that future iterations of generative models will be trained on both clean and artificially generated data from past models. In this paper, we develop a framework to rigorously study the impact of training generative models on mixed datasets---from classical training on real data to self-consuming generative models trained on purely synthetic data. We first prove the stability of iterative training under the condition that the initial generative models approximate the data distribution well enough and the proportion of clean training data (w.r.t. synthetic data) is large enough. We empirically validate our theory on both synthetic and natural images by iteratively training normalizing flows and state-of-the-art diffusion models on CIFAR10 and FFHQ."}, "primary_area": {"value": "generative models"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/119c01132e3767a01a8777074185c4c7f8fb3824.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nbertrand2024on,\ntitle={On the Stability of Iterative Retraining of Generative Models on their own Data},\nauthor={Quentin Bertrand and Joey Bose and Alexandre Duplessis and Marco Jiralerspong and Gauthier Gidel},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=JORAfH2xFd}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "bertrand|on_the_stability_of_iterative_retraining_of_generative_models_on_their_own_data"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2785/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2785/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2785/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410856484, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 27, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "generative models", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "rmg0qMKYRQ", "forum": "rmg0qMKYRQ", "number": 2718, "cdate": 1695227026567, "tcdate": 1695227026567, "mdate": 1709661491991, "tmdate": 1709661491991, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2718/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2718/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Intriguing Properties of Generative Classifiers"}, "authors": {"value": ["Priyank Jaini", "Kevin Clark", "Robert Geirhos"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Priyank_Jaini1", "~Kevin_Clark1", "~Robert_Geirhos1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["diffusion models", "zero-shot", "text-to-image", "generative models", "human visual perception", "psychophysics", "cognitive science", "neuroscience"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "Generative classifiers based on text-to-image generative models approximate human object recognition data surprisingly well."}, "abstract": {"value": "What is the best paradigm to recognize objects---discriminative inference (fast but potentially prone to shortcut learning) or using a generative model (slow but potentially more robust)?

Our new theoretical analysis shows that the diversity and separatability of learned skills are fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not necessarily guarantee them. To improve MISL, we propose a novel disentanglement metric LSEPIN and build an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP. It is theoretically justified to be helpful to task adaptation and it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than MISL.

Adequate high-quality data, coupled with deep models capable of inference, are both indispensable and prerequisite for achieving meaningful results. However, the sparsity of data and the high costs associated with deploying sensors lead to significant data imbalances. Models that are overly tailored and lack causal relationships further compromise the generalizabilities of inference methods. Towards this end, we first establish a causal concept for ST predictions, named  NuwaDynamics, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Concretely, we initially leverage upstream self-supervision to discern causal important patches, imbuing the model with generalized information and conducting informed interventions on complementary trivial patches to extrapolate potential test distributions. This phase is referred to as the discovery step. Advancing beyond discovery step, we transfer the data to downstream tasks for targeted ST objectives, aiding the model in recognizing a broader potential distribution and fostering its causal perceptual capabilities (refer as Update step). Our concept aligns seamlessly with the contemporary backdoor adjustment mechanism in causality theory. Extensive experiments on six real-world ST benchmarks showcase that models can gain outcomes upon the integration of the NuwaDynamics concept.

However, as they are typically trained from a given extrinsic reward function, it remains an important open challenge about how to leverage the power of pre-training and train GFlowNets in an unsupervised fashion for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks.\nInspired by recent successes of unsupervised pre-training in various domains, we introduce a novel approach for reward-free pre-training of GFlowNets. By framing the training as a self-supervised problem, we propose an outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) that learns to explore the candidate space. Specifically, OC-GFN learns to reach any targeted outcomes, akin to goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning. \nWe show that the pre-trained OC-GFN model can allow for a direct extraction of a policy capable of sampling from any new reward functions in downstream tasks.\nNonetheless, adapting OC-GFN on a downstream task-specific reward involves an intractable marginalization over possible outcomes. We propose a novel way to approximate this marginalization by learning an amortized predictor enabling efficient fine-tuning.\nExtensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training the OC-GFN, and its ability to swiftly adapt to downstream tasks and discover modes more efficiently.\nThis work may serve as a foundation for further exploration of pre-training strategies in the context of GFlowNets."}, "primary_area": {"value": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)"},

the efficacious implementation of large-scale distributed training techniques. Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-series optimizers which mitigate memory consumption of model states with large model training. We also provide a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound. Furthermore, we validate our findings through an extensive set of practical experiments encompassing a wide range of tasks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. These experiments serve to demonstrate the capabilities of CO2 in terms of convergence, generalization, and scalability when deployed across configurations comprising up to 128 A100 GPUs. The outcomes emphasize the outstanding capacity of CO2 to hugely improve scalability, no matter on clusters with 800Gbps RDMA or 80Gbps TCP/IP inter-node connections."}, "primary_area": {"value": "optimization"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/81103680cdf97ee7c0afa17e78b1b069b3facde6.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nsun2024co,\ntitle={{CO}2: Efficient Distributed Training with Full Communication-Computation Overlap},\nauthor={Weigao Sun and Zhen Qin and Weixuan Sun and Shidi Li and Dong Li and Xuyang Shen and Yu Qiao and Yiran Zhong},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZO5cn4IfaN}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "sun|co2_efficient_distributed_training_with_full_communicationcomputation_overlap"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2582/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2582/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2582/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410850862, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 24, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "optimization", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "zMoNrajk2X", "forum": "zMoNrajk2X", "number": 2574, "cdate": 1695216662214, "tcdate": 1695216662214, "mdate": 1713223804780, "tmdate": 1713223804780, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2574/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2574/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "CADS: Unleashing the Diversity of Diffusion Models through Condition-Annealed Sampling"}, "authors": {"value": ["Seyedmorteza Sadat", "Jakob Buhmann", "Derek Bradley", "Otmar Hilliges", "Romann M.

To tackle the above problems, we propose Image2Sentence based Asymmetric zero-shot composed image retrieval (ISA), which takes advantage of the VL model and only relies on unlabeled images for composition learning. In the framework, we propose a new adaptive token learner that maps an image to a sentence in the word embedding space of VL model.  The sentence adaptively captures discriminative visual information and is further integrated with the text modifier. An asymmetric structure is devised for flexible deployment, in which the lightweight model is adopted for the query side while the large VL model is deployed on the gallery side. The global contrastive distillation and the local alignment regularization are adopted for the alignment between the light model and the VL model for CIR task.

Existing methods to alleviate the costly sampling process include model distillation and designing dedicated ODE solvers. However, distillation is costly to train and sometimes can deteriorate quality, while dedicated solvers still require relatively large NFE to produce high quality samples. In this paper we introduce ``Bespoke solvers'', a novel framework for constructing custom ODE solvers tailored to the ODE of a given pre-trained flow model. Our approach optimizes an order consistent and parameter-efficient solver (e.g., with 80 learnable parameters), is trained for roughly 1\\% of the GPU time required for training the pre-trained model, and significantly improves approximation and generation quality compared to dedicated solvers. For example, a Bespoke solver for a CIFAR10 model produces samples with Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.73 with 10 NFE, and gets to 1\\% of the Ground Truth (GT) FID (2.59) for this model with only 20 NFE.

We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent.

We introduce an SSL model that leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, complemented by HuBERT-style masked prediction objectives, to process speech at multiple resolutions.

Particle-based variational inference (ParVI) methods enhance diversity by formalizing a repulsion term based on a network similarity kernel. However, weight-space repulsion is inefficient due to over-parameterization, while direct function-space repulsion has been found to produce little improvement over DEs. To sidestep these difficulties, we propose First-order Repulsive Deep Ensemble (FoRDE), an ensemble learning method based on ParVI, which performs repulsion in the space of first-order input gradients. As input gradients uniquely characterize a function up to translation and are much smaller in dimension than the weights, this method guarantees that ensemble members are functionally different. Intuitively, diversifying the input gradients encourages each network to learn different features, which is expected to improve the robustness of an ensemble. Experiments on image classification datasets and transfer learning tasks show that FoRDE significantly outperforms the gold-standard DEs and other ensemble methods in accuracy and calibration under covariate shift due to input perturbations."}, "primary_area": {"value": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/bea7988b0afcf3076721719ce7a16e7b479e4de8.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/9051ebcb267f3101b5766b887c71216f3f29d45f.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\ntrinh2024inputgradient,\ntitle={Input-gradient space particle inference for neural network ensembles},\nauthor={Trung Trinh and Markus Heinonen and Luigi Acerbi and Samuel Kaski},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=nLWiR5P3wr}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "trinh|inputgradient_space_particle_inference_for_neural_network_ensembles"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2353/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2353/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2353/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410845018, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 20, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "otHZ8JAIgh", "forum": "otHZ8JAIgh", "number": 2319, "cdate": 1695193646227, "tcdate": 1695193646227, "mdate": 1713117072640, "tmdate": 1713117072640, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2319/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2319/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Prototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling for Multimodal Cancer Survival Prediction"}, "authors": {"value": ["Yilan Zhang", "Yingxue Xu", "Jianqi Chen", "Fengying Xie", "Hao Chen"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Yilan_Zhang1", "~Yingxue_Xu1", "~Jianqi_Chen1", "~Fengying_Xie1", "~Hao_Chen1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["multimodal survival prediction", "computational pathology"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Multimodal learning significantly benefits cancer survival prediction, especially the integration of pathological images and genomic data. Despite advantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive redundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and compact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated information blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic data, leading to an \"intra-modal redundancy\" issue. (2) Duplicated information among modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes modality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an \"inter-modal redundancy\" issue. To address these, we propose a new framework, Prototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling (PIBD), consisting of Prototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and Prototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal redundancy. Specifically, a variant of information bottleneck, PIB, is proposed to model prototypes approximating a bunch of instances for different risk levels, which can be used for selection of discriminative instances within modality. PID module decouples entangled multimodal data into compact distinct components: modality-common and modality-specific knowledge, under the guidance of the joint prototypical distribution.

However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks. To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity. MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category. (2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions. (3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs. With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points. Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation. We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data. We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models. The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems.

Arguably, backdoor trigger inversion (BTI), which generates trigger patterns of given benign samples for a backdoored model, is the most critical module for backdoor defenses used in these scenarios. With BTI, defenders can remove backdoors by fine-tuning based on generated poisoned samples with ground-truth labels or deactivate backdoors by removing trigger patterns during the inference process. However, we find that existing BTI methods suffer from relatively poor performance, $i.e.$, their generated triggers are significantly different from the ones used by the adversaries even in the feature space. We argue that it is mostly because existing methods require to 'extract' backdoor features at first, while this task is very difficult since defenders have no information ($e.g.$, trigger pattern or target label) about poisoned samples. In this paper, we explore BTI from another perspective where we decouple benign features instead of decoupling backdoor features directly. Specifically, our method consists of two main steps, including \\textbf{(1)} decoupling benign features and \\textbf{(2)} trigger inversion by minimizing the differences between benign samples and their generated poisoned version in decoupled benign features while maximizing the differences in remaining backdoor features. In particular, our method is more efficient since it doesn't need to `scan' all classes to speculate the target label, as required by existing BTI. We also exploit our BTI module to further design backdoor-removal and pre-processing-based defenses. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our defenses can reach state-of-the-art performances."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety,

Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for effective damage control. Traditional physics-based models, while comprehensive, are computationally intensive and rely heavily on the expertise of forecasters. Contemporary data-driven methods often rely on reanalysis data, which can be considered to be the closest to the true representation of weather conditions. However, reanalysis data is not produced in real-time and requires time for adjustment since prediction models are calibrated with observational data. This reanalysis data, such as ERA5, falls short in challenging real-world situations. Optimal preparedness necessitates predictions at least 72 hours in advance, beyond the capabilities of standard physics models. In response to these constraints, we present an approach that harnesses real-time Unified Model (UM) data, sidestepping the limitations of reanalysis data. Our model provides predictions at 6-hour intervals for up to 72 hours in advance and outperforms both state-of-the-art data-driven methods and numerical weather prediction models.

These methods aim to distinguish forged faces from genuine ones and have proven effective in practical applications. However, this paper introduces a novel and previously unrecognized threat in face forgery detection scenarios caused by backdoor attack. By embedding backdoors into models and incorporating specific trigger patterns into the input, attackers can deceive detectors into producing erroneous predictions for forged faces. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes \\emph{Poisoned Forgery Face} framework, which enables clean-label backdoor attacks on face forgery detectors. Our approach involves constructing a scalable trigger generator and utilizing a novel convolving process to generate translation-sensitive trigger patterns. Moreover, we employ a relative embedding method based on landmark-based regions to enhance the stealthiness of the poisoned samples. Consequently, detectors trained on our poisoned samples are embedded with backdoors. Notably, our approach surpasses SoTA backdoor baselines with a significant improvement in attack success rate (+16.39\\% BD-AUC) and reduction in visibility (-12.65\\% $L_\\infty$).

However, existing deep tabular ML methods suffer from the representation entanglement and localization, which largely hinders their prediction performance and leads to  performance inconsistency on tabular tasks.\nTo overcome these problems, we explore a novel direction of applying prototype learning for tabular ML and propose a prototype-based tabular representation learning framework, PTaRL, for tabular prediction tasks. The core idea of PTaRL is to construct prototype-based projection space (P-Space) and learn the disentangled representation around global data prototypes. Specifically, PTaRL mainly involves two stages: (i) Prototype Generating, that constructs global prototypes as the basis vectors of P-Space for representation, and (ii) Prototype Projecting, that projects the data samples into P-Space and keeps the core global data information via Optimal Transport. Then, to further acquire the disentangled representations, we constrain PTaRL with two strategies: (i) to diversify the coordinates towards global prototypes of different representations within P-Space, we bring up a diversifying constraint for representation calibration; (ii) to avoid prototype entanglement in P-Space, we introduce a matrix orthogonalization constraint to ensure the independence of global prototypes. \nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments in PTaRL coupled with state-of-the-art deep tabular ML models on various tabular benchmarks and the results have shown our consistent superiority."}, "primary_area": {"value": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/015d2b21c36da1eda54d0672c954af346b0c8ae1.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nye2024ptarl,\ntitle={{PT}a{RL}: Prototype-based Tabular Representation Learning via Space Calibration},\nauthor={Hangting Ye and Wei Fan and Xiaozhuang Song and Shun Zheng and He Zhao and Dan dan Guo and Yi Chang},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=G32oY4Vnm8}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "ye|ptarl_prototypebased_tabular_representation_learning_via_space_calibration"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "pdate": 1705410840427, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2154/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2154/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2154/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 14, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "4VIgNuQ1pY", "forum": "4VIgNuQ1pY", "number": 2125, "cdate": 1695170370483, "tcdate": 1695170370483, "mdate": 1710314589282, "tmdate": 1710314589282, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2125/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2125/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations in Analyzing Irregular Time Series Data"}, "authors": {"value": ["YongKyung Oh", "Dongyoung Lim", "Sungil Kim"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~YongKyung_Oh1", "~Dongyoung_Lim1", "~Sungil_Kim1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Neural Ordinary Differential Equations", "Neural Stochastic Differential Equations", "Irregular time series data"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations"}, "abstract": {"value": "Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates.

This nascent thesis proposes that facts are recalled from the training corpus through the MLP weights in a manner resembling key-value memory, implying in effect that \"knowledge\" is stored in the network. Furthermore, by modifying the MLP modules, one can control the language model's generation of factual information.

SSM is crucial in clinical research, enabling population-level analysis of morphological variation in bones and organs. Traditional methods of SSM construction have limitations, including the requirement of noise-free surface meshes or binary volumes, reliance on assumptions or templates, and prolonged inference times due to simultaneous optimization of the entire cohort. Point2SSM overcomes these barriers by providing a data-driven solution that infers SSMs directly from raw point clouds, reducing inference burdens and increasing applicability as point clouds are more easily acquired. While deep learning on 3D point clouds has seen success in unsupervised representation learning and shape correspondence, its application to anatomical SSM construction is largely unexplored. We conduct a benchmark of state-of-the-art point cloud deep networks on the SSM task, revealing their limited robustness to clinical challenges such as noisy, sparse, or incomplete input and limited training data. Point2SSM addresses these issues through an attention-based module, providing effective correspondence mappings from learned point features. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing networks in terms of accurate surface sampling and correspondence, better capturing population-level statistics.

In this paper, we focus on domain shifts, which occur when the model is applied to new domains that are different from the ones it was trained on, and propose a new approach called DG. Unlike previous approaches that aim to learn a single model that is domain invariant, DG leverages domain similarities based on domain metadata to learn domain-specific models. Concretely, DG learns a set of training-domain-specific functions during the training stage and reweights them based on domain relations during the test stage. These domain relations can be directly obtained and learned from domain metadata. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically prove that using domain relations to reweight training-domain-specific functions achieves stronger out-of-domain generalization compared to the conventional averaging approach. Empirically, we evaluate the effectiveness of DG using both toy and real-world datasets for tasks such as temperature regression, land use classification, and molecule-protein binding affinity prediction.

However, these models lack explicit control over the 3D structure in the generated images. Consequently, this hinders our ability to obtain detailed 3D annotations for the generated images or to craft instances with specific poses and distances. In this paper, we propose 3D Diffusion Style Transfer (3D-DST), which incorporates 3D geometry control into diffusion models. Our method exploits ControlNet, which extends diffusion models by using visual prompts in addition to text prompts. We generate images of the 3D objects taken from 3D shape repositories~(e.g., ShapeNet and Objaverse), render them from a variety of poses and viewing directions, compute the edge maps of the rendered images, and use these edge maps as visual prompts to generate realistic images. With explicit 3D geometry control, we can easily change the 3D structures of the objects in the generated images and obtain ground-truth 3D annotations automatically. This allows us to improve a wide range of vision tasks, e.g., classification and 3D pose estimation, in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on ImageNet-100/200, ImageNet-R, PASCAL3D+, ObjectNet3D, and OOD-CV.

This establishes  some of the rich predictions that have arisen from extensive numerical studies in the last decade about the spectra of Hessian and information matrices over the course of training in overparametrized networks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "learning theory"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/c8dc4127b70cc66dd5a649a848ee32a1b553666a.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\narous2024highdimensional,\ntitle={High-dimensional {SGD} aligns with emerging outlier eigenspaces},\nauthor={Gerard Ben Arous and Reza Gheissari and Jiaoyang Huang and Aukosh Jagannath},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=MHjigVnI04}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "arous|highdimensional_sgd_aligns_with_emerging_outlier_eigenspaces"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2000/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2000/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2000/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410836021, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 22, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "learning theory", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "fLf589bx1f", "forum": "fLf589bx1f", "number": 1982, "cdate": 1695142160345, "tcdate": 1695142160345, "mdate": 1713672402547, "tmdate": 1713672402547, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1982/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1982/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "$\\mathcal{B}$-Coder: Value-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Program Synthesis"}, "authors": {"value": ["Zishun Yu", "Yunzhe Tao", "Liyu Chen", "Tao Sun", "Hongxia Yang"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Zishun_Yu1", "~Yunzhe_Tao2", "~Liyu_Chen1", "~Tao_Sun14", "~Hongxia_Yang2"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Program Synthesis", "Code Generation", "Reinforcement Learning", "Value-Based RL"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Program synthesis aims to create accurate, executable programs from problem specifications, specifically from natural language descriptions in our context. \nRecent studies have leveraged the power of reinforcement learning (RL) in conjunction with large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing code generation capabilities. The application of RL focuses on directly optimizing for functional correctness, offering an advantage over conventional supervised methods. \nDespite policy-based RL methods dominating the literature on RL for program synthesis, the nature of program synthesis tasks hints at a natural alignment with value-based methods.\nThis stems from the rich collection of off-policy programs, including those developed by human programmers and also historical samples, coupled with the straightforward verification of generated programs through automated unit testing, meaning rewards are easy to obtain.\nDiverging from the dominant use of policy-based algorithms, our work explores the feasibility of value-based approaches, leading to the development of our $\\mathcal{B}$-Coder (pronounced Bellman coder).\nYet, training value-based methods presents challenges due to the enormous search space inherent to program synthesis. \nTo this end, we introduce an initialization protocol for RL agents utilizing pre-trained LMs and a conservative Bellman operator to reduce training complexities. \nMoreover, we demonstrate how to leverage the learned value functions as a dual strategy to post-process generated programs. \nOur empirical evaluations demonstrated $\\mathcal{B}$-Coder's capability in achieving state-of-the-art performance when compared to policy-based methods.

limitations of LLMs' static parametric memory.\nHowever, how receptive are LLMs to such external evidence, especially when the evidence conflicts with their parametric memory? \nWe present the first comprehensive and controlled investigation into the behavior of LLMs when encountering knowledge conflicts.\nWe propose a systematic framework to elicit high-quality parametric memory from LLMs and construct the corresponding counter-memory, which enables us to conduct a series of controlled experiments.\nOur investigation reveals seemingly contradicting behaviors of LLMs.\nOn the one hand, different from prior wisdom, we find that LLMs can be highly receptive to external evidence even when that conflicts with their parametric memory, given that the external evidence is coherent and convincing.\nOn the other hand, LLMs also demonstrate a strong confirmation bias when the external evidence contains some information that is consistent with their parametric memory, despite being presented with conflicting evidence at the same time.\nThese results pose important implications that are worth careful consideration for the further development and deployment of tool- and retrieval-augmented LLMs.\nResources are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/LLM-Knowledge-Conflict."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety,

We consider episode-wise random variables to model episode-specific generative processes, where these local random variables are governed by a higher-level global random variable. The global variable captures information shared across episodes, while controlling how much the model needs to be adapted to new episodes in a principled Bayesian manner. Within our  framework, prediction on a novel episode/task can be seen as a Bayesian inference problem. For tractable training, we need to be able to relate each local episode-specific solution to the global higher-level parameters. We propose a Normal-Inverse-Wishart model, for which establishing this local-global relationship becomes feasible due to the approximate closed-form solutions for the local posterior distributions. The resulting algorithm is more attractive than the MAML in that it does not maintain a costly computational graph for the sequence of gradient descent steps in an episode. Our approach is also different from existing Bayesian meta learning methods in that rather than modeling a single random variable for all episodes, it leverages a hierarchical structure that exploits the local-global relationships desirable for principled Bayesian learning with many related tasks."}, "primary_area": {"value": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/92f087e2b731b4e0629d1db29e70e1a90a9d076f.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/55645679512920438f3f5d32717a02eef451866a.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nkim2024a,\ntitle={A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Few-Shot Meta Learning},\nauthor={Minyoung Kim and Timothy Hospedales},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=mQ72XRfYRZ}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "kim|a_hierarchical_bayesian_model_for_fewshot_meta_learning"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1947/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1947/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1947/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410834796, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 21, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "yKksu38BpM", "forum": "yKksu38BpM", "number": 1902, "cdate": 1695133145835, "tcdate": 1695133145835, "mdate": 1709661482885, "tmdate": 1709661482885, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1902/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1902/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Faithful and Efficient Explanations for Neural Networks via Neural Tangent Kernel Surrogate Models"}, "authors": {"value": ["Andrew William Engel", "Zhichao Wang", "Natalie Frank", "Ioana Dumitriu", "Sutanay Choudhury", "Anand Sarwate", "Tony Chiang"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Andrew_William_Engel1", "~Zhichao_Wang3", "~Natalie_Frank1", "~Ioana_Dumitriu3", "~Sutanay_Choudhury2", "~Anand_Sarwate1", "~Tony_Chiang1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Explainability", "Surrogate Models", "Neural Tangent Kernel", "Deep Learning", "Attribution"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We evaluate new approximate neural tangent kernel, including random projection variants that cost less to compute and store."}, "abstract": {"value": "A recent trend in explainable AI research has focused on surrogate modeling, where neural networks are approximated as simpler ML algorithms such as kernel machines. A second trend has been to utilize kernel functions in various explain-by-example or data attribution tasks. In this work, we combine these two trends to analyze approximate empirical neural tangent kernels (eNTK) for data attribution. Approximation is critical for eNTK analysis due to the high computational cost to compute the eNTK.

We model single-step retrosynthesis as a distribution learning problem in a discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation benchmarks."}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/20efd425e667325385a150734d8f20307ab8ccd4.pdf"}, "primary_area": {"value": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/5425ef5b68639ce9c53f9c8ea9f651d33a1ddbfe.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nigashov2024retrobridge,\ntitle={RetroBridge: Modeling Retrosynthesis with Markov Bridges},\nauthor={Ilia Igashov and Arne Schneuing and Marwin Segler and Michael M.

The proposed semantic graph prior jointly learns scene appearances and layout distributions, exhibiting versatility across various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. To facilitate the benchmarking for text-driven 3D scene synthesis, we curate a high-quality dataset of scene-instruction pairs with large language and multimodal models.

Compared to the imaging domain, which is rich with large available datasets, the number of data instances for the motion domain is limited, particularly for the animation of animals and exotic creatures (e.g., dragons), which have unique skeletons and motion patterns. In this work, we introduce SinMDM, a Single Motion Diffusion Model. It is designed to learn the internal motifs of a single motion sequence with arbitrary topology and synthesize a variety of motions of arbitrary length that remain faithful to the learned motifs. We harness the power of diffusion models and present a denoising network explicitly designed for the task of learning from a single input motion. SinMDM is crafted as a lightweight architecture, which avoids overfitting by using a shallow network with local attention layers that narrow the receptive field and encourage motion diversity. Our work applies to multiple contexts, including spatial and temporal in-betweening, motion expansion, style transfer, and crowd animation. Our results show that SinMDM outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, while prior network-based approaches require additional training for different applications, SinMDM supports these applications during inference.

This paper introduces PixArt-$\\alpha$, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PixArt-$\\alpha$'s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PixArt-$\\alpha$ only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (~675 vs. ~6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly \\\\$300,000 (\\\\$26,000 vs. \\\\$320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PixArt-$\\alpha$ excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control.

Most existing CIR models adopt the late-fusion strategy to combine visual and language features. Besides, several approaches have also been suggested to generate a pseudo-word token from the reference image, which is further integrated into the relative caption for CIR. However, these pseudo-word-based prompting methods have limitations when target image encompasses complex changes on reference image, e.g., object removal and attribute modification. In this work, we demonstrate that learning an appropriate sentence-level prompt for the relative caption (SPRC) is sufficient for achieving effective composed image retrieval. Instead of relying on pseudo- word-based prompts, we propose to leverage pretrained V-L models, e.g., BLIP-2, to generate sentence-level prompts.

Inverse design is typically formulated as an optimization problem, with recent works leveraging optimization across learned dynamics models. However, as models are optimized they tend to fall into adversarial modes, preventing effective sampling. We illustrate that by instead optimizing over the learned energy function captured by the diffusion model, we can avoid such adversarial examples and significantly improve design performance. We further illustrate how such a design system is compositional, enabling us to combine multiple different diffusion models representing subcomponents of our desired system to design systems with every specified component. In an N-body interaction task and a challenging 2D multi-airfoil design task, we demonstrate that by composing the learned diffusion model at test time, our method allows us to design initial states and boundary shapes that are more complex than those in the training data. Our method generalizes to more objects for N-body dataset and discovers formation flying to minimize drag in the multi-airfoil design task.

We first prove that AD always returns a generalized derivative called a Clarke subderivative for networks with pointwise activation functions, if the minibatch size is one and all non-differentiable neurons have distinct bias parameters. We show that the same conclusion does not hold otherwise, but does hold under some mild sufficient conditions.

However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, leading to low performance, especially in extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization ($\\textbf{OmniQuant}$) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. OmniQuant comprises two innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping (LWC) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET). LWC modulates the extreme values of weights by optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, LET tackles activation outliers by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations to weights. Operating within a differentiable framework using block-wise error minimization, OmniQuant can optimize the quantization process efficiently for both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. For instance, the LLaMA-2 model family size 7-70B can be processed with OmniQuant on a single A100-40G GPU within 1-16 hours using 128 samples. Extensive experiments validate OmniQuant's superior performance across diverse quantization configurations such as W4A4 (4-bit weight, 4-bit activation), W6A6, W4A16, W3A16, and W2A16. Additionally, OmniQuant demonstrates effectiveness in instruction-tuned models and delivers notable improvements in inference speed and memory reduction on real devices.

To unify referring and grounding in the LLM paradigm, Ferret employs a novel and powerful hybrid region representation that integrates discrete coordinates and continuous features jointly to represent a region in the image. To extract the continuous features of versatile regions,  we propose a spatial-aware visual sampler, adept at handling varying sparsity across different shapes. Consequently, Ferret can accept diverse region inputs, such as points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes. To bolster the desired capability of Ferret, we curate GRIT, a comprehensive refer-and-ground instruction tuning dataset including 1.1M samples that contain rich hierarchical spatial knowledge, with an additional 130K hard negative data to promote model robustness.

However, existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often suffer limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of 'weight saliency' for MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation. This innovation directs MU's attention toward specific model weights rather than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap with 'exact' unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the forgetting data points). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first principled MU approach that can effectively erase the influence of forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and generation tasks. As highlighted below, For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy, outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion and Forget-Me-Not.

of a powerful new trend in which large language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language agents capable of performing objective oriented multi-step tasks on their own, rather than merely responding to queries from human users. Most existing language agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment."}, "primary_area": {"value": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/d02f39256b41ec50ca8cd3a5b136065bc7a4caae.pdf"}, "TLDR": {"value": "This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient."}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nyao2024retroformer,\ntitle={Retroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradient Optimization},\nauthor={Weiran Yao and Shelby Heinecke and Juan Carlos Niebles and Zhiwei Liu and Yihao Feng and Le Xue and Rithesh R N and Zeyuan Chen and Jianguo Zhang and Devansh Arpit and Ran Xu and Phil L Mui and Huan Wang and Caiming Xiong and Silvio Savarese},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=KOZu91CzbK}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "yao|retroformer_retrospective_large_language_agents_with_policy_gradient_optimization"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1478/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1478/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1478/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410821588, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 24, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "k9SVcrmXL8", "forum": "k9SVcrmXL8", "number": 1421, "cdate": 1695056025574, "tcdate": 1695056025574, "mdate": 1713672307619, "tmdate": 1713672307619, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1421/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1421/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "BECLR: Batch Enhanced Contrastive Few-Shot Learning"}, "authors": {"value": ["Stylianos Poulakakis-Daktylidis", "Hadi Jamali-Rad"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Stylianos_Poulakakis-Daktylidis1", "~Hadi_Jamali-Rad1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["few-shot classification", "unsupervised few-shot learning", "deep representation learning"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Learning quickly from very few labeled samples is a fundamental attribute that separates machines and humans in the era of deep representation learning.

We propose a novel Dynamic Clustered mEmory (DyCE) module to promote a highly separable latent representation space for enhancing positive sampling at the pretraining phase and infusing implicit class-level insights into unsupervised contrastive learning. We then tackle the, somehow overlooked yet critical, issue of sample bias at the few-shot inference stage.

Here, $\\exp()$ is applied entry-wise and ${\\bf 1}_n$ denotes a length-$n$ vector whose entries are all ones.\n\nIntuitively, attention computation captures pairwise information between words in a sentence, but not higher-order information. Indeed, recent work \\cite{sht23} has shown that attention units cannot solve simple problems about detecting triples of connected words.\n\nIn this work, we study a generalization of attention which captures triple-wise  correlations. The generalization is based on computations involving tensors defined by tuples of words. More formally, given five $n \\times d$ size matrices $Q, K_1, K_2, V_1$ and $V_2$ (generalized query, key, and value tokens), our new goal is to compute an $n \\times d$ size matrix $D^{-1} \\exp( Q ( K_1 \\oslash K_2)^\\top ) (V_1 \\oslash V_2) $ where $D = \\mathrm{diag}( \\exp( Q ( K_1 \\oslash K_2)^\\top ) {\\bf 1}_{n^2} )$ and $K_1 \\oslash K_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n^2 \\times d}$ denotes the column-wise Kronecker product of $K_1$ and $K_2$. This generalization is indeed able to solve problems about detecting triple-wise connections that were shown to be impossible for transformers.\n\nThe potential downside of this generalization is that it appears as though computations are even more difficult, since the straightforward algorithm requires cubic time in $n$. However, we show that in the bounded-entry setting (which arises in practice, and which is well-studied in both theory and practice), there is actually a near-linear time algorithm. More precisely, we show that bounded entries are both necessary and sufficient for quickly performing generalized computations:\n\n$\\bullet$ On the positive side, if all entries of the input matrices are bounded above by $o(\\sqrt[3]{\\log n})$ then we show how to approximate the ``tensor-type'' attention matrix in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time.\n\n$\\bullet$ On the negative side, we show that if the entries of the input matrices may be as large as $\\Omega(\\sqrt[3]{\\log n})$, then there is no algorithm that runs faster than $n^{3-o(1)}$ (assuming the Strong Exponential \nTime Hypothesis from fine-grained complexity theory).\n\n\nWe also show that our construction, algorithms, and lower bounds naturally generalize to higher-order tensors and correlations. Interestingly, the higher the order of the tensors, the lower the bound on the entries needs to be for an efficient algorithm.

This approach circumvents the limitations and information loss inherent to external feature extractors like CLIP, and a more thorough multimodal understanding is obtained. Second, DreamLLM fosters the generation of raw, interleaved documents, modeling both text and image contents, along with unstructured layouts. This allows DreamLLM to learn all conditional, marginal, and joint multimodal distributions effectively. As a result, DreamLLM is the first MLLM capable of generating free-form interleaved content. Comprehensive experiments highlight DreamLLM's superior performance as a zero-shot multimodal generalist, reaping from the enhanced learning synergy.

By synthesizing videos that \"hallucinate\" robot executing actions and in combination with dense correspondences between frames, our approach can infer the closed-formed action to execute to an environment without the need of any explicit action labels. This unique capability allows us to train the policy solely based on RGB videos and deploy learned policies to various robotic tasks.

As a first step, we study the landscape of BO through the lens of penalty methods, in which the upper- and lower-level objectives are combined in a weighted sum with penalty parameter $\\sigma > 0$. In particular, we establish a strong connection between the penalty function and the hyper-objective by explicitly characterizing the conditions under which the values and derivatives of the two must be $O(\\sigma)$-close. A by-product of our analysis is the explicit formula for the gradient of hyper-objective when the lower-level problem has multiple solutions under minimal conditions, which could be of independent interest. Next, viewing the penalty formulation as $O(\\sigma)$-approximation of the original BO, we propose first-order algorithms that find an $\\epsilon$-stationary solution by optimizing the penalty formulation with $\\sigma = O(\\epsilon)$. When the perturbed lower-level problem uniformly satisfies the {\\it small-error} proximal error-bound (EB) condition,  we propose a first-order algorithm that converges to an $\\epsilon$-stationary point of the penalty function using in total $O(\\epsilon^{-7})$ accesses to first-order stochastic gradient oracles.

In this setting, we identify the first scaling law describing the relationship between weight sparsity, number of non-zero parameters, and amount of training data, which we validate empirically across model and data scales; on ViT/JFT-4B and T5/C4. These results allow us to characterize the \"optimal sparsity\", the sparsity level which yields the best performance for a given effective model size and training budget. For a fixed number of non-zero parameters, we identify that the optimal sparsity increases with the amount of data used for training.

In this paper, we propose a novel image editing method, DragonDiffusion, enabling Drag-style manipulation on Diffusion models. Specifically, we treat image editing as the change of feature correspondence in a pre-trained diffusion model. By leveraging feature correspondence, we develop energy functions that align with the editing target, transforming image editing operations into gradient guidance. Based on this guidance approach, we also construct multi-scale guidance that considers both semantic and geometric alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate a visual cross-attention strategy based on a memory bank design to ensure consistency between the edited result and original image. Benefiting from these efficient designs, all content editing and consistency operations come from the feature correspondence without extra model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has promising performance on various image editing tasks, including within a single image (e.g., object moving, resizing, and content dragging) or across images (e.g., appearance replacing and object pasting).

Uni3D uses a 2D initialized ViT end-to-end pretrained to align the 3D point cloud features with the image-text aligned features. Via the simple architecture and pretext task, Uni3D can leverage abundant 2D pretrained models as initialization and image-text aligned models as the target, unlocking the great potential of 2D model zoos and scaling-up strategies to the 3D world. We efficiently scale up Uni3D to one billion parameters, and set new records on a broad range of 3D tasks, such as zero-shot classification, few-shot classification, open-world understanding and zero-shot part segmentation.

However, the predominant emphasis in most interactive environments is on learning, often at the expense of complexity in reasoning. In this paper, we introduce CivRealm, an environment inspired by the Civilization game. Civilization\u2019s profound alignment with human society requires sophisticated learning and prior knowledge, while its ever-changing space and action space demand robust reasoning for generalization. Particularly, CivRealm sets up an imperfect-information general-sum game with a changing number of players; it presents a plethora of complex features, challenging the agent to deal with open-ended stochastic environments that require diplomacy and negotiation skills. Within CivRealm, we provide interfaces for two typical agent types: tensor-based agents that focus on learning, and language-based agents that emphasize reasoning. To catalyze further research, we present initial results for both paradigms.

While learning-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, they generalize poorly to in-the-wild images. Such methods typically need to train separate models for different scene types (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) and are impractical when the scene type is unknown in advance. One of the underlying problems is the limited scalability of existing data construction pipelines, which limits the diversity of standard image matching datasets. To address this problem, we propose GIM, a self-training framework for learning a single generalizable model based on any image matching architecture using internet videos, an abundant and diverse data source. Given an architecture, GIM first trains it on standard domain-specific datasets and then combines it with complementary matching methods to create dense labels on nearby frames of novel videos. These labels are filtered by robust fitting, and then enhanced by propagating them to distant frames. The final model is trained on propagated data with strong augmentations. Not relying on complex 3D reconstruction makes GIM much more efficient and less likely to fail than standard SfM-and-MVS based frameworks. We also propose ZEB, the first zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching. By mixing data from diverse domains, ZEB can thoroughly assess the cross-domain generalization performance of different methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of GIM. Applying GIM consistently improves the zero-shot performance of 3 state-of-the-art image matching architectures as the number of downloaded videos increases (Fig. 1 (a)); with 50 hours of YouTube videos, the relative zero-shot performance improves by 6.9% \u2212 18.1%. GIM also enables generalization to extreme cross-domain data such as Bird Eye View (BEV) images of projected 3D point clouds (Fig. 1 (c)). More importantly, our single zero-shot model consistently outperforms domain-specific baselines when evaluated on downstream tasks inherent to their respective domains.

Using pretrained large-scale 2D diffusion models, recent work Zero123 demonstrates the ability to generate plausible novel views from a single-view image of an object. However, maintaining consistency in geometry and colors for the generated images remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a synchronized multiview diffusion model that models the joint probability distribution of multiview images, enabling the generation of multiview-consistent images in a single reverse process. SyncDreamer synchronizes the intermediate states of all the generated images at every step of the reverse process through a 3D-aware feature attention mechanism that correlates the corresponding features across different views. Experiments show that SyncDreamer generates images with high consistency across different views, thus making it well-suited for various 3D generation tasks such as novel-view-synthesis, text-to-3D, and image-to-3D.

However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRegressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space.

The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT.

While existing FR algorithms primarily focus on optimizing margins and loss functions, limited attention has been given to exploring the feature representation space. Therefore, this paper endeavors to improve FR performance in the view of feature representation space. Firstly, we consider two FR models that exhibit distinct performance discrepancies, where one model exhibits superior recognition accuracy compared to the other. We implement orthogonal decomposition on the features from the superior model along those from the inferior model and obtain two sub-features. Surprisingly, we find the sub-feature perpendicular to the inferior still possesses a certain level of face distinguishability. We adjust the modulus of the sub-features and recombine them through vector addition. Experiments demonstrate this recombination is likely to contribute to an improved facial feature representation, even better than features from the original superior model. Motivated by this discovery, we further consider how to improve FR accuracy when there is only one FR model available. Inspired by knowledge distillation, we incorporate the intra-class incoherence constraint (IIC) to solve the problem. Experiments on various FR benchmarks show the existing state-of-the-art method with IIC can be further improved, highlighting its potential to further enhance FR performance."}, "primary_area": {"value": "representation learning for computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/64f49baaba5e3d14bb727d898b334143acfde5f7.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nhuang2024enhanced,\ntitle={Enhanced Face Recognition using Intra-class Incoherence Constraint},\nauthor={Yuanqing Huang and Yinggui Wang and Le Yang and Lei Wang},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=uELjxVbrqG}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "huang|enhanced_face_recognition_using_intraclass_incoherence_constraint"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1105/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1105/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1105/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410810847, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 14, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "representation learning for computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "9w3iw8wDuE", "forum": "9w3iw8wDuE", "number": 1097, "cdate": 1695008060830, "tcdate": 1695008060830, "mdate": 1713672946759, "tmdate": 1713672946759, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1097/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1097/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Entropy is not Enough for Test-Time Adaptation: From the Perspective of Disentangled Factors"}, "authors": {"value": ["Jonghyun Lee", "Dahuin Jung", "Saehyung Lee", "Junsung Park", "Juhyeon Shin", "Uiwon Hwang", "Sungroh Yoon"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Jonghyun_Lee1", "~Dahuin_Jung2", "~Saehyung_Lee1", "~Junsung_Park1", "~Juhyeon_Shin1", "~Uiwon_Hwang1", "~Sungroh_Yoon1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Test-time adaptation", "Roustness"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "We first address the limitations of relying solely on entropy as a confidence metric for TTA.

The primary challenge of TTA is limited access to the entire test dataset during online updates, causing error accumulation. To mitigate it, TTA methods have utilized the model output's entropy as a confidence metric that aims to determine which samples have a lower likelihood of causing error. Through experimental studies, however, we observed the unreliability of entropy as a confidence metric for TTA under biased scenarios and theoretically revealed that it stems from the neglect of the influence of latent disentangled factors of data on predictions. Building upon these findings, we introduce a novel TTA method named Destroy Your Object (DeYO), which leverages a newly proposed confidence metric named Pseudo-Label Probability Difference (PLPD). PLPD quantifies the influence of the shape of an object on prediction by measuring the difference between predictions before and after applying an object-destructive transformation. DeYO consists of sample selection and sample weighting, which employ entropy and PLPD concurrently. For robust adaptation, DeYO prioritizes samples that dominantly incorporate shape information when making predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of DeYO over baseline methods across various scenarios, including biased and wild.

The key idea is to use a complex and high-order degradation model to mimic real-world degradations. \nAlthough they have achieved impressive results in various scenarios, they are faced with the obstacle of evaluation. Currently, these methods are only assessed by their average performance on a small set of degradation cases randomly selected from a large space, which fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of their overall performance and often yields inconsistent and potentially misleading results.\nTo overcome the limitation in evaluation, we propose SEAL, a framework for systematic evaluation of real-SR. In particular, we cluster the extensive degradation space to create a set of representative degradation cases, which serves as a comprehensive test set. Next, we propose a coarse-to-fine evaluation protocol to measure the distributed and relative performance of real-SR methods on the test set.

To close this gap, inspired by the recent efforts of learning EBMs by maximimizing diffusion recovery likelihood (DRL), we propose cooperative diffusion recovery likelihood (CDRL), an effective approach to tractably learn and sample from a series of EBMs defined on increasingly noisy versons of a dataset, paired with an initializer model for each EBM. At each noise level, the two models are jointly estimated within a cooperative training framework: Samples from the initializer serve as starting points that are refined by a few MCMC sampling steps from the EBM. The EBM is then optimized by maximizing recovery likelihood, while the initializer model is optimized by learning from the difference between the refined samples and the initial samples. In addition, we made several practical designs for EBM training to further improve the sample quality. Combining these advances, we significantly boost the generation performance compared to existing EBM methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32. And we have shown that CDRL has great potential to largely reduce the sampling time.

We propose a straightforward yet effective method for identifying data contamination within LLMs. At its core, our approach starts by identifying potential contamination at the instance level; using this information, our approach then assesses wider contamination at the partition level. To estimate contamination of individual instances, we employ \"guided instruction:\" a prompt consisting of the dataset name, partition type, and the random-length initial segment of a reference instance, asking the LLM to complete it. An instance is flagged as contaminated if the LLM's output either exactly or nearly matches the latter segment of the reference. To understand if an entire partition is contaminated, we propose two ideas. The first idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if the average overlap score with the reference instances (as measured by ROUGE-L or BLEURT) is statistically significantly better with the completions from guided instruction compared to a \"general instruction\" that does not include the dataset and partition name. The second idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if a classifier based on GPT-4 with few-shot in-context learning prompt marks multiple generated completions as exact/near-exact matches of the corresponding reference instances. Our best method achieves an accuracy between 92% and 100% in detecting if an LLM is contaminated with seven datasets, containing train and test/validation partitions, when contrasted with manual evaluation by human experts.

SDEs offer a versatile tool for modeling real-world continuous-time dynamic systems with inherent noise and randomness. Combining SDEs with the powerful inference capabilities of variational methods, enables the learning of representative distributions through stochastic gradient descent. However, conventional SDEs typically assume  the underlying noise to follow a Brownian motion (BM), which hinders their ability to capture long-term dependencies. In contrast, fractional Brownian motion (fBM) extends BM to encompass non-Markovian dynamics, but existing methods for inferring fBM parameters are either computationally demanding or statistically inefficient. \n\nIn this paper, building upon the Markov approximation of fBM, we derive the evidence lower bound essential for efficient variational inference of posterior path measures, drawing from the well-established field of stochastic analysis.

In this article, we take a step in this direction by establishing an implicit regularization of deep residual networks towards neural ODEs, for nonlinear networks trained with gradient flow. We prove that if the network is initialized as a discretization of a neural ODE, then such a discretization holds throughout training. Our results are valid for a finite training time, and also as the training time tends to infinity provided that the network satisfies a Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz condition. Importantly, this condition holds for a family of residual networks where the residuals are two-layer perceptrons with an overparameterization in width that is only linear, and implies the convergence of gradient flow to a global minimum.

PET has gained popularity, especially in the context of large-scale models, due to its ability to reduce transfer learning costs and conserve hardware resources. However, existing PET approaches primarily focus on recognition tasks and typically support uni-modal optimization, while neglecting dense prediction tasks and vision language interactions.

Our main idea is to explore the local neighborhood via backtracking and reconstruction guided by backward and forward policies, respectively. This allows biasing the samples toward high-reward solutions, which is not possible for a typical GFlowNet solution generation scheme, which uses the forward policy to generate the solution from scratch.

In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.

VIS leverages the optimal proposal distribution, achieved by minimizing the forward $\\chi^2$ divergence, to enhance marginal log-likelihood estimation. We apply VIS to various popular latent variable models, including mixture models, variational auto-encoders, and partially observable generalized linear models.

Widely used initialization methods are proposed and evaluated for networks that are trained from scratch. However, the growing number of pretrained models now offers new opportunities for tackling this classical problem of weight initialization. In this work, we introduce weight selection, a method for initializing smaller models by selecting a subset of weights from a pretrained larger model. This enables the transfer of knowledge from pretrained weights to smaller models.

While they have been intensively studied in classification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely overlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every pixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on segmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a specific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed Influencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the classification accuracy of non-victim pixels and mislead classifications of all victim pixels in every single inference and could be easily applied to real-world scenes. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentation models, we proposed a simple, yet effective, Nearest-Neighbor trigger injection strategy. We also introduce an innovative Pixel Random Labeling strategy which maintains optimal performance even when the trigger is placed far from the victim pixels. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation models do suffer from backdoor attacks, demonstrate IBA real-world applicability, and show that our proposed techniques can further increase attack performance."}, "primary_area": {"value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/81df12528640b4d855f26ec8e8c61fb38da33dcd.pdf"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nlan2024influencer,\ntitle={Influencer Backdoor Attack on Semantic Segmentation},\nauthor={Haoheng Lan and Jindong Gu and Philip Torr and Hengshuang Zhao},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=VmGRoNDQgJ}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "lan|influencer_backdoor_attack_on_semantic_segmentation"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission751/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission751/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission751/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410802830, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 17, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "noe76eRcPC", "forum": "noe76eRcPC", "number": 750, "cdate": 1694902622620, "tcdate": 1694902622620, "mdate": 1710427483080, "tmdate": 1710427483080, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission750/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission750/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "PF-LRM: Pose-Free Large Reconstruction Model for Joint Pose and Shape Prediction"}, "authors": {"value": ["Peng Wang", "Hao Tan", "Sai Bi", "Yinghao Xu", "Fujun Luan", "Kalyan Sunkavalli", "Wenping Wang", "Zexiang Xu", "Kai Zhang"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Peng_Wang17", "~Hao_Tan1", "~Sai_Bi1", "~Yinghao_Xu1", "~Fujun_Luan2", "~Kalyan_Sunkavalli1", "~Wenping_Wang1", "~Zexiang_Xu1", "~Kai_Zhang7"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Pose estimation", "NeRF", "3D Reconstruction", "Transformer"]}, "abstract": {"value": "We propose a Pose-Free Large Reconstruction Model (PF-LRM) for reconstructing a 3D object from a few unposed images even with little visual overlap, while simultaneously estimating the relative camera poses in ~1.3 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

Such a decomposition provides RoboFlamingo the flexibility for open-loop control and deployment on low-performance platforms. By exceeding the state-of-the-art performance with a large margin on the tested benchmark, we show RoboFlamingo can be an effective and competitive alternative to adapt VLMs to robot control.\nOur extensive experimental results also reveal several interesting conclusions regarding the behavior of different pre-trained VLMs on manipulation tasks.

Nevertheless, there is still an inadequacy in assessing the abilities of MLLMs on **low-level visual perception and understanding**. To address this gap, we present **Q-Bench**, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate potential abilities of MLLMs on three realms: low-level visual perception, low-level visual description, and overall visual quality assessment. **_a)_** To evaluate the low-level **_perception_** ability, we construct the **LLVisionQA** dataset, consisting of 2,990 diverse-sourced images, each equipped with a human-asked question focusing on its low-level attributes. We then measure the correctness of MLLMs on answering these questions. **_b)_** To examine the **_description_** ability of MLLMs on low-level information, we propose the **LLDescribe** dataset consisting of long expert-labelled *golden* low-level text descriptions on 499 images, and a GPT-involved comparison pipeline between outputs of MLLMs and the *golden* descriptions. **_c)_** Besides these two tasks, we further measure their visual quality **_assessment_** ability to align with human opinion scores. Specifically, we design a softmax-based strategy that enables MLLMs to predict *quantifiable* quality scores, and evaluate them on various existing image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. Our evaluation across the three abilities confirms that MLLMs possess preliminary low-level visual skills.

These forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformers are challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. Besides, the embedding for each temporal token fuses multiple variates that represent potential delayed events and distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning variate-centric representations and result in meaningless attention maps. In this work, we reflect on the competent duties of Transformer components and repurpose the Transformer architecture without any modification to the basic components. We propose iTransformer that simply applies the attention and feed-forward network on the inverted dimensions. Specifically, the time points of individual series are embedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model achieves state-of-the-art on challenging real-world datasets, which further empowers the Transformer family with promoted performance, generalization ability across different variates, and better utilization of arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice alternative as the fundamental backbone of time series forecasting.

These methods typically depend on protein structure encoders to model residue backbone frames, where atoms do not exist. Most prior encoders rely on atom-wise features, such as angles and distances between atoms, which are not available in this context. Only a few basic encoders, like IPA, have been proposed for this scenario, exposing the frame modeling as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce the Vector Field Network (VFN), that enables network layers to perform learnable vector computations between coordinates of frame-anchored virtual atoms, thus achieving a higher capability for modeling frames. The vector computation operates in a manner similar to a linear layer, with each input channel receiving 3D virtual atom coordinates instead of scalar values. The multiple feature vectors output by the vector computation are then used to update the residue representations and virtual atom coordinates via attention aggregation. Remarkably, VFN also excels in modeling both frames and atoms, as the real atoms can be treated as the virtual atoms for modeling, positioning VFN as a potential $\\textit{universal encoder}$. In protein diffusion (frame modeling), VFN exhibits a impressive performance advantage over IPA, excelling in terms of both designability ($\\textbf{67.04}$\\% vs. 53.58\\%) and diversity ($\\textbf{66.54}$\\% vs. 51.98\\%). In inverse folding(frame and atom modeling), VFN outperforms the previous SoTA model, PiFold ($\\textbf{54.7}$\\% vs. 51.66\\%), on sequence recovery rate; we also propose a method of equipping VFN with the ESM model, which significantly surpasses the previous ESM-based SoTA ($\\textbf{62.67}$\\% vs. 55.65\\%), LM-Design, by a substantial margin.

Its forgetting is therefore reduced as this instance-wise query mechanism enables us to select and update only relevant prompts. In this paper, we further integrate prompt-tuning with gradient projection approach. Our observation is: prompt-tuning releases the necessity of task identifier for gradient projection method; and gradient projection provides theoretical guarantees against forgetting for prompt-tuning. This inspires a new prompt gradient projection approach (PGP) for continual learning. In PGP, we deduce that reaching the orthogonal condition for prompt gradient can effectively prevent forgetting via the self-attention mechanism in vision-transformer. The condition equations are then realized by conducting Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on an element-wise sum space between input space and prompt space. We validate our method on diverse datasets and experiments demonstrate the efficiency of reducing forgetting both in class incremental, online class incremental, and task incremental settings.

Guided by the subjective logic theory, EDL obtains Dirichlet concentration parameters from deep neural networks, thus constructing a Dirichlet probability density function (PDF) to model the distribution of class probabilities. Despite its great success, we argue that EDL keeps nonessential settings in both stages of model construction and optimization.\nIn this work, our analysis indicates that (1) in the construction of the Dirichlet PDF, a commonly ignored parameter termed prior weight governs the balance between leveraging the proportion of evidence and its magnitude in deriving predictive scores, and (2) in model optimization, a variance-minimized regularization term adopted by traditional EDL encourages the Dirichlet PDF to approach a Dirac delta function, potentially exacerbating overconfidence. Therefore, we propose the R-EDL (Relaxed-EDL) method by relaxing these nonessential settings. Specifically, R-EDL treats the prior weight as an adjustable hyper-parameter instead of a fixed scalar, and directly optimizes the expectation of the Dirichlet PDF provided to deprecate the variance-minimized regularization term.

In this paper, we study the OOD problem from a neuron activation view. We first formulate neuron activation states by considering both the neuron output and its influence on model decisions. Then, to characterize the relationship between neurons and OOD issues, we introduce the *neuron activation coverage* (NAC) -- a simple measure for neuron behaviors under InD data. Leveraging our NAC, we show that 1) InD and OOD inputs can be largely separated based on the neuron behavior, which significantly eases the OOD detection problem and beats the 21 previous methods over three benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K). 2) a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability consistently holds across architectures and datasets, which enables a NAC-based criterion for evaluating model robustness. Compared to prevalent InD validation criteria, we show that NAC not only can select more robust models, but also has a stronger correlation with OOD test performance."}, "primary_area": {"value": "visualization or interpretation of learned representations"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/4c57d3fc275b61826d7f559c23288a82feebda62.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": ""}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nliu2024neuron,\ntitle={Neuron Activation Coverage: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection and Generalization},\nauthor={Yibing Liu and Chris XING TIAN and Haoliang Li and Lei Ma and Shiqi Wang},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SNGXbZtK6Q}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "liu|neuron_activation_coverage_rethinking_outofdistribution_detection_and_generalization"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission577/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission577/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission577/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410798156, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 25, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "visualization or interpretation of learned representations", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "EHrvRNs2Y0", "forum": "EHrvRNs2Y0", "number": 573, "cdate": 1694843797013, "tcdate": 1694843797013, "mdate": 1710517037140, "tmdate": 1710517037140, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission573/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission573/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "ResFields: Residual Neural Fields for Spatiotemporal Signals"}, "authors": {"value": ["Marko Mihajlovic", "Sergey Prokudin", "Marc Pollefeys", "Siyu Tang"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Marko_Mihajlovic1", "~Sergey_Prokudin1", "~Marc_Pollefeys2", "~Siyu_Tang1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["neural fields", "NeRF", "reconstruction"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "A novel time-dependent layer for MLPs to improve capturing and reconstruction of spatiotemporal signals."}, "abstract": {"value": "Neural fields, a category of neural networks trained to represent high-frequency signals, have gained significant attention in recent years due to their impressive performance in modeling complex 3D data, such as signed distance (SDFs) or radiance fields (NeRFs), via a single multi-layer perceptron (MLP). However, despite the power and simplicity of representing signals with an MLP, these methods still face challenges when modeling large and complex temporal signals due to the limited capacity of MLPs. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to address this limitation by incorporating temporal residual layers into neural fields, dubbed ResFields. It is a novel class of networks specifically designed to effectively represent complex temporal signals. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the properties of ResFields and propose a matrix factorization technique to reduce the number of trainable parameters and enhance generalization capabilities. Importantly, our formulation seamlessly integrates with existing MLP-based neural fields and consistently improves results across various challenging tasks: 2D video approximation, dynamic shape modeling via temporal SDFs, and dynamic NeRF reconstruction. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of ResFields by showcasing its effectiveness in capturing dynamic 3D scenes from sparse RGBD cameras of a lightweight capture system."}, "primary_area": {"value": "representation learning for computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/f19ba6990ec3698aae30dc2d3ca992a323a90cc3.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/c940abe6e7e613858353395cbc81ead9a3663022.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nmihajlovic2024resfields,\ntitle={ResFields: Residual Neural Fields for Spatiotemporal Signals},\nauthor={Marko Mihajlovic and Sergey Prokudin and Marc Pollefeys and Siyu Tang},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=EHrvRNs2Y0}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "mihajlovic|resfields_residual_neural_fields_for_spatiotemporal_signals"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission573/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission573/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission573/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410797976, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 17, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "representation learning for computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "Oxh5CstDJU", "forum": "Oxh5CstDJU", "number": 559, "cdate": 1694839306078, "tcdate": 1694839306078, "mdate": 1710536642854, "tmdate": 1710536642854, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission559/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission559/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "TD-MPC2: Scalable, Robust World Models for Continuous Control"}, "authors": {"value": ["Nicklas Hansen", "Hao Su", "Xiaolong Wang"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Nicklas_Hansen1", "~Hao_Su1", "~Xiaolong_Wang3"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["reinforcement learning", "model-based reinforcement learning", "world models"]}, "TLDR": {"value": "TD-MPC2 is a scalable, robust model-based RL algorithm that can be applied to diverse single-task and multi-task continuous control domains with a single set of hyperparameters."}, "abstract": {"value": "TD-MPC is a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that performs local trajectory optimization in the latent space of a learned implicit (decoder-free) world model.

In this paper, we present AnimateDiff, a practical framework for animating personalized T2I models without requiring model-specific tuning. At the core of our framework is a plug-and-play motion module that can be trained once and seamlessly integrated into any personalized T2Is originating from the same base T2I. Through our proposed training strategy, the motion module effectively learns transferable motion priors from real-world videos. Once trained, the motion module can be inserted into a personalized T2I model to form a personalized animation generator. We further propose MotionLoRA, a lightweight fine-tuning technique for AnimateDiff that enables a pre-trained motion module to adapt to new motion patterns, such as different shot types, at a low training and data collection cost. We evaluate AnimateDiff and MotionLoRA on several public representative personalized T2I models collected from the community.

Due to the high dimensionality of humanoids and the inherent difficulties in reinforcement learning, prior methods have focused on learning skill embeddings for a narrow range of movement styles (e.g. locomotion, game characters) from specialized motion datasets. This limited scope hampers their applicability in complex tasks. We close this gap by significantly increasing the coverage of our motion representation space. To achieve this, we first learn a motion imitator that can imitate all of human motion from a large, unstructured motion dataset. We then create our motion representation by distilling skills directly from the imitator. This is achieved by using an encoder-decoder structure with a variational information bottleneck. Additionally, we jointly learn a prior conditioned on proprioception (humanoid's own pose and velocities) to improve model expressiveness and sampling efficiency for downstream tasks. By sampling from the prior, we can generate long, stable, and diverse human motions. Using this latent space for hierarchical RL, we show that our policies solve tasks using human-like behavior.

Specifically, neural plasticity should be critical in the context of constantly changing reinforcement learning (RL) environments, yet current approaches still primarily employ static activation functions. In this work, we motivate the use of adaptable activation functions in RL and show that rational activation functions are particularly suitable for augmenting plasticity. Inspired by residual networks, we derive a condition under which rational units are closed under residual connections and formulate a naturally regularised version. The proposed joint-rational activation allows for desirable degrees of flexibility, yet regularises plasticity to an extent that avoids overfitting by leveraging a mutual set of activation function parameters across layers. We demonstrate that equipping popular algorithms with (joint) rational activations leads to consistent improvements on different games from the Atari Learning Environment benchmark, notably making DQN competitive to DDQN and Rainbow."}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/0ecc8520a8a62e463d88c1c7abc28fb1fc02ca9a.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/2737cb738844f05ff8a16a71d451d1c4da59b318.pdf"}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\ndelfosse2024adaptive,\ntitle={Adaptive Rational Activations to Boost Deep Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Quentin Delfosse and Patrick Schramowski and Martin Mundt and Alejandro Molina and Kristian Kersting},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=g90ysX1sVs}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "delfosse|adaptive_rational_activations_to_boost_deep_reinforcement_learning"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission451/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission451/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410795036, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 16, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "reinforcement learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "wISvONp3Kq", "forum": "wISvONp3Kq", "number": 448, "cdate": 1694815130328, "tcdate": 1694815130328, "mdate": 1709661467507, "tmdate": 1709661467507, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission448/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission448/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Learning No-Regret Sparse Generalized Linear Models with Varying Observation(s)"}, "authors": {"value": ["Diyang Li", "Charles Ling", "zhiqiang xu", "Huan Xiong", "Bin Gu"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Diyang_Li1", "~Charles_Ling1", "~zhiqiang_xu1", "~Huan_Xiong1", "~Bin_Gu1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Generalized Linear Models", "Learning with Varying Data", "Differential Equations"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) encompass a wide array of regression and classification models, where prediction is a function of a linear combination of the input variables. Often in real-world scenarios, a number of observations would be added into or removed from the existing training dataset, necessitating the development of learning systems that can efficiently train optimal models with varying observations in an online (sequential) manner instead of retraining from scratch. Despite the significance of data-varying scenarios, most existing approaches to sparse GLMs concentrate on offline batch updates, leaving online solutions largely underexplored. In this work, we present the first algorithm without compromising accuracy for GLMs regularized by sparsity-enforcing penalties trained on varying observations. Our methodology is capable of handling the addition and deletion of observations simultaneously, while adaptively updating data-dependent regularization parameters to ensure the best statistical performance. Specifically, we recast sparse GLMs as a bilevel optimization objective upon varying observations and characterize it as an explicit gradient flow in the underlying space for the inner and outer subproblems we are optimizing over, respectively. We further derive a set of rules to ensure a proper transition at regions of non-smoothness, and establish the guarantees of theoretical consistency and finite convergence.

*prompt injection attacks*: malicious third party prompts that subvert the intent of the system designer. To help researchers study this problem, we present a dataset of over 563,000 prompt injection attacks and 118,000 prompt-based \"defenses\" against prompt injection, all created by players of an online game called Tensor Trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that includes both human-generated attacks and defenses for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in our dataset have easily interpretable structure, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. We also use the dataset to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection, which we refer to as *prompt extraction* and *prompt hijacking*. Our benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, we show that some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game.

However, automatically collecting such data (e.g. via large-scale web scraping) leads to low quality and poor image-text correlation, while human annotation is more accurate but requires significant manual effort and expense. We introduce $\\textbf{ITIT}$ ($\\textbf{I}$n$\\textbf{T}$egrating $\\textbf{I}$mage $\\textbf{T}$ext): an innovative training paradigm grounded in the concept of cycle consistency which allows vision-language training on $\\textit{unpaired}$ image and text data. ITIT is comprised of a joint image-text encoder with disjoint image and text decoders that enable bidirectional image-to-text and text-to-image generation in a single framework. During training, ITIT leverages a small set of paired image-text data to ensure its output matches the input reasonably well in both directions. Simultaneously, the model is also trained on much larger datasets containing only images or texts. This is achieved by enforcing cycle consistency between the original unpaired samples and the cycle-generated counterparts. For instance, it generates a caption for a given input image and then uses the caption to create an output image, and enforces similarity between the input and output images. Our experiments show that ITIT with unpaired datasets exhibits similar scaling behavior as using high-quality paired data. We demonstrate image generation and captioning performance on par with state-of-the-art text-to-image and image-to-text models with orders of magnitude fewer (only 3M) paired image-text data.

In this work, we focus on computational fluid dynamics and address the shortcomings of a large part of the literature, which are based on fixed support for computations and predictions in the form of regular or irregular grids. We propose a novel setup to perform predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain while being trained on sparse observations. We formulate the task as a double observation problem and propose a solution with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain, which allows to forecast and interpolate a solution from the initial condition. Our practical implementation involves recurrent GNNs and a spatio-temporal attention observer capable of interpolating the solution at arbitrary locations. Our model not only generalizes to new initial conditions (as standard auto-regressive models do) but also performs evaluation at arbitrary space and time locations.

This work shows that modern LLMs are vulnerable to option position changes in MCQs due to their inherent \u201cselection bias\u201d, namely, they prefer to select specific option IDs as answers (like \u201cOption A\u201d). Through extensive empirical analyses with 20 LLMs on three benchmarks, we pinpoint that this behavioral bias primarily stems from LLMs\u2019 token bias, where the model a priori assigns more probabilistic mass to specific option ID tokens (e.g., A/B/C/D) when predicting answers from the option IDs. To mitigate selection bias, we propose a label-free, inference-time debiasing method, called PriDe, which separates the model\u2019s prior bias for option IDs from the overall prediction distribution. PriDe first estimates the prior by permutating option contents on a small number of test samples, and then applies the estimated prior to debias the remaining samples. We demonstrate that it achieves interpretable and transferable debiasing with high computational efficiency.

To this end, Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) trains a protagonist against destabilizing forces exercised by an adversary in a competitive zero-sum Markov game, whose optimal solution, i.e., rational strategy, corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. However, finding Nash equilibria requires facing complex saddle point optimization problems, which can be prohibitive to solve, especially for high-dimensional control. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for adversarial RL based on entropy regularization to ease the complexity of the saddle point optimization problem. We show that the solution of this entropy-regularized problem corresponds to a Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), a generalization of Nash equilibria that accounts for bounded rationality, i.e., agents sometimes play random actions instead of optimal ones. Crucially, the connection between the entropy-regularized objective and QRE enables free modulation of the rationality of the agents by simply tuning the temperature coefficient. We leverage this insight to propose our novel algorithm, Quantal Adversarial RL (QARL), which gradually increases the rationality of the adversary in a curriculum fashion until it is fully rational, easing the complexity of the optimization problem while retaining robustness. We provide extensive evidence of QARL outperforming RARL and recent baselines across several MuJoCo locomotion and navigation problems in overall performance and robustness."}, "primary_area": {"value": "reinforcement learning"}, "code_of_ethics": {"value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics."}, "submission_guidelines": {"value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide."}, "anonymous_url": {"value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity."}, "no_acknowledgement_section": {"value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review."}, "venue": {"value": "ICLR 2024 spotlight"}, "venueid": {"value": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference"}, "pdf": {"value": "/pdf/8a7e2e74cb77bfa87eaf438766767c4f2fc26a18.pdf"}, "supplementary_material": {"value": "/attachment/beecd5122fe4c4570bf1f897ca61aa6b8392273d.zip"}, "_bibtex": {"value": "@inproceedings{\nreddi2024robust,\ntitle={Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning via Bounded Rationality Curricula},\nauthor={Aryaman Reddi and Maximilian T{\\\"o}lle and Jan Peters and Georgia Chalvatzaki and Carlo D'Eramo},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=pFOoOdaiue}\n}"}, "paperhash": {"value": "reddi|robust_adversarial_reinforcement_learning_via_bounded_rationality_curricula"}}, "odate": 1697213872796, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission198/-/Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission198/-/Rebuttal_Revision", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission198/-/Camera_Ready_Revision"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "pdate": 1705410788899, "version": 2, "details": {"replyCount": 15, "presentation": [{"name": "title", "order": 1}, {"name": "authors", "order": 3}, {"name": "code_of_ethics", "order": 3, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.", "description": null}, {"name": "authorids", "order": 4}, {"name": "keywords", "order": 4}, {"name": "submission_guidelines", "order": 4, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.", "description": null}, {"name": "TLDR", "order": 5, "fieldName": "TL;DR"}, {"name": "abstract", "order": 6, "input": "textarea", "markdown": true}, {"name": "pdf", "order": 7}, {"name": "anonymous_url", "order": 7, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.", "description": null}, {"name": "supplementary_material", "order": 8}, {"name": "no_acknowledgement_section", "order": 8, "input": "checkbox", "value": "I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.", "description": null}, {"name": "primary_area", "order": 9, "input": "select", "value": "reinforcement learning", "description": null}, {"name": "resubmission"}, {"name": "student_author"}, {"name": "large_language_models"}, {"name": "other_comments_on_LLMs"}, {"name": "venue", "hidden": true}, {"name": "venueid", "hidden": true}, {"name": "_bibtex", "input": "textarea"}, {"name": "other_comments"}]}}, {"id": "BXY6fe7q31", "forum": "BXY6fe7q31", "number": 192, "cdate": 1694775987442, "tcdate": 1694775987442, "mdate": 1713672907323, "tmdate": 1713672907323, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission192/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2024/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2024/Conference/Submission192/Authors"], "content": {"title": {"value": "Fine-tuning Multimodal LLMs to Follow Zero-shot Demonstrative Instructions"}, "authors": {"value": ["Juncheng Li", "Kaihang Pan", "Zhiqi Ge", "Minghe Gao", "Wei Ji", "Wenqiao Zhang", "Tat-Seng Chua", "Siliang Tang", "Hanwang Zhang", "Yueting Zhuang"]}, "authorids": {"value": ["~Juncheng_Li3", "~Kaihang_Pan1", "~Zhiqi_Ge1", "~Minghe_Gao1", "~Wei_Ji1", "~Wenqiao_Zhang1", "~Tat-Seng_Chua2", "~Siliang_Tang1", "~Hanwang_Zhang3", "~Yueting_Zhuang1"]}, "keywords": {"value": ["Multimodal Large Language Models", "Demonstrative Instruction"]}, "abstract": {"value": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been utilizing Visual Prompt Generators (VPGs) to convert visual features into tokens that LLMs can recognize. This is achieved by training the VPGs on millions of image-caption pairs, where the VPG-generated tokens of images are fed into a frozen LLM to generate the corresponding captions. However, this image-captioning based training objective inherently biases the VPG to concentrate solely on the primary visual contents sufficient for caption generation, often neglecting other visual details. This shortcoming results in MLLMs\u2019 underperformance in comprehending demonstrative instructions consisting of multiple, interleaved, and multimodal instructions that demonstrate the required context to complete a task. To address this issue, we introduce a generic and lightweight Visual Prompt Generator Complete module (VPG-C), which can infer and complete the missing details essential for comprehending demonstrative instructions. Further, we propose a synthetic discriminative training strategy to fine-tune VPG-C, eliminating the need for supervised demonstrative instructions. As for evaluation, we build DEMON, a comprehensive benchmark for demonstrative instruction understanding.

Existing research on learning from multi-source data mostly assume that each client owns the data of all modalities, which may largely limit its practicability. In light of the expensiveness and sparsity of multimodal data, we propose patchwork learning to jointly learn from fragmented multimodal data in distributed clients. Considering the concerns on data privacy, patchwork learning aims to impute incomplete multimodal data for diverse downstream tasks without accessing the raw data directly. Local clients could miss different modality combinations. Due to the statistical heterogeneity induced by non-i.i.d. data, the imputation is more challenging since the learned dependencies fail to adapt to the imputation of other clients. In this paper, we provide a novel imputation framework to tackle modality combination heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity simultaneously, called ``collaborative adaptation''. In particular, for two observed modality combinations from two clients, we learn the transformations between their maximal intersection and other modalities by proposing a novel ELBO. We improve the worst-performing required transformations through a Pareto min-max optimization framework.

While recent studies have demonstrated the impressive performance of deep SNNs on challenging tasks, their energy efficiency advantage has been diminished. Existing methods targeting energy consumption reduction do not fully exploit sparsity, whereas powerful pruning methods can achieve high sparsity but are not directly targeted at energy efficiency, limiting their effectiveness in energy saving. Furthermore, none of these works fully exploit the sparsity of neurons or the potential for unstructured neuron pruning in SNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning framework that combines unstructured weight pruning with unstructured neuron pruning to maximize the utilization of the sparsity of neuromorphic computing, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of unstructured neuron pruning to deep SNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that  our method achieves impressive energy efficiency gains. The sparse network pruned by our method with only 0.63\\% remaining connections can achieve a remarkable 91 times increase in energy efficiency compared to the original dense network, requiring only 8.5M SOPs for inference, with merely 2.19\\% accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

However, this approach faces limitations when applied to scene-centric datasets, where multiple objects within an image are only implicitly captured in the global representation. Such global bootstrapping can lead to undesirable entanglement of object representations. Furthermore, even object-centric datasets stand to benefit from a finer-grained bootstrapping approach. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel $\\textbf{Cr}$oss-$\\textbf{I}$mage Object-Level $\\textbf{Bo}$otstrapping method tailored to enhance dense visual representation learning. By employing object-level nearest neighbor bootstrapping throughout the training, CrIBo emerges as a notably strong and adequate candidate for in-context learning, leveraging nearest neighbor retrieval at test time. CrIBo shows state-of-the-art performance on the latter task while being highly competitive in more standard downstream segmentation tasks.

The existing methods fail to simultaneously achieve the goals of accurate 3D avatar reconstruction and stable talking face animation. Besides, while the existing works mainly focus on synthesizing the head part, it is also vital to generate natural torso and background segments to obtain a realistic talking portrait video. To address these limitations, we present Real3D-Potrait, a framework that (1) improves the one-shot 3D reconstruction power with a large image-to-plane model that distills 3D prior knowledge from a 3D face generative model; (2) facilitates accurate motion-conditioned animation with an efficient motion adapter; (3) synthesizes realistic video with natural torso movement and switchable background using a head-torso-background super-resolution model; and (4) supports one-shot audio-driven talking face generation with a generalizable audio-to-motion model. Extensive experiments show that Real3D-Portrait generalizes well to unseen identities and generates more realistic talking portrait videos compared to previous methods.
